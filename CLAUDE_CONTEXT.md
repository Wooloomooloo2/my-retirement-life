## ▶ Next session — resume here (paused 2026-06-05)

Session 11 shipped the **"spending unfunded" signal** (item 61 below) — the engine now flags spending it can't draw from eligible accounts, closing the item-65 false-positive where a plan reported green "On track" on money locked in not-yet-accessible accounts. Committed + code-complete; **verified headlessly (16 checks) but not yet smoke-tested by Mark in the live app.**

**Open verification tasks (no code outstanding — confirmation only):**
1. **Session 11 — "spending unfunded" UI** (item 61): in the live app, build a plan that strands spending (e.g. set a high `drawdownMinAge` on the investment/pension accounts so cash exhausts first) and confirm: the confidence card flips to red **"Spending unfunded from YYYY"** with the locked-balances clause; the `/projection` **Table** tab grows an **Unfunded** column with red-highlighted rows; CSV includes it; a healthy plan shows none of this (no column).
2. **Session 9 browser-only UX** (item 60), still open: drag-to-reorder gesture on `/drawdown-strategy`, the withdrawals chart rendering with its Total/Per-account toggle, and the Table CSV actually downloading. Drive a real webview via `/run` (or `/verify`).

**Backlog (carried forward, pick from these next):**
- **Monte Carlo doesn't count unfunded** — `run_monte_carlo` `success_rate` still keys off balance>0 only, so MC can call a locked-money plan a success while the deterministic engine flags it unfunded. Natural follow-on to item 61.
- **Disappearing-★ chart bug** (item 56) — real bug still in 5 charts (`projection.html` ×3, `budget.html`, `dashboard.html`); proven data-point-marker fix in `investment_projection.html` to copy.
- **Routing-vs-drawdown trap UI guard** (item 54 carry-forward).

**Two data-driven findings (NOT bugs), from session 10:**
1. On Mark's live data a **4% RMD rate is nearly non-binding** — he already draws `MS 401(k)` faster than 4%; the floor only bites at higher rates.
2. Mark's plan has **only 2 surplus years (2026–27)** — he retires in 2027 — so an **emergency fund can't fill to a months-of-spend target**; it fills with the ~£6.7k of surplus then is drawn first in 2028. Both correct behaviour.

Also note: the **Table tab renders one row per projection year = 39 rows for Mark's plan** (the old "57" was a longer-horizon scenario).

Watch the store-lock contention noted in session 6 (line ~130) if a dev server and the packaged app run at once.

## Project overview

**My Retirement Life (MRL)** is a local-first personal retirement planning application.
The user is a business architect and data modeller — Claude does all coding.

- **GitHub:** `Wooloomooloo2/my-retirement-life`
- **Stack:** Python 3.13 + FastAPI, pyoxigraph (Oxigraph triple store), HTMX + Tailwind + DaisyUI, Chart.js, NumPy
- **Platform:** Windows (VS Code), repo at `C:\Users\hallm\Documents\GitHub\my-retirement-life`, `.venv` present. Also runs on macOS (Apple Silicon) at `/Users/markhall/Projects/my-retirement-life` — session 6 added macOS packaging + native window support. Linux deferred.
- **Data storage:** Oxigraph RDF triple store at `AppData/Local/MyRetirementLife/store` (via `platformdirs`)
- **Ontology:** `mrl-ontology.ttl`, version **1.0.7** (ADR-019 — emergency fund on `mrl:ProjectionSettings`; 1.0.6 added the ADR-018 mandatory-withdrawal pair on `mrl:Account`). 17 `Currency` individuals total. Live store reloaded to 1.0.7 on 2026-06-03 (was lagging at 1.0.4 — caught at the start of session 9; `tools/reload_ontology.py` run, verified).

---

## Working agreement (how the user wants Claude to work)

**On Claude Code (current workflow, from 2026-05-24):**
- Edit files directly with the Edit/Write tools — user reviews the diff in the harness.
- Still **state the full repo path** of every file touched so the change is unambiguous.
- Still **don't guess** the contents of files you haven't read — read them first.
- When working on this machine, the repo lives at `C:\Users\hallm\Documents\GitHub\my-retirement-life`, NOT `C:\Projects\my-retirement-life` (that was the previous machine).

**On chat (legacy workflow, kept for reference):**
- Deliver full files, never snippets, with the full repo path; user assembles manually one at a time. Minimise re-touching already-installed files.

## Changes in session 11 (2026-06-05)

_One feature, no ontology change. Driven against an isolated copy of the live store (`DATA_DIR=/tmp`); live data verified intact afterward (12 accounts, baseline £2,133,952 — unchanged). Note: the live store's `CURRENT`/`LOG` housekeeping files showed an open at 09:27 with **no data writes** (no new `.sst`, no flushes) — almost certainly Mark's own app, since every harness command set `DATA_DIR=/tmp`; the live data graph was never written by this session._

61. **ADR-018 follow-on — "spending unfunded" signal. Closes the item-65 false positive.** Until now the engine **silently discarded** any spending shortfall that eligible accounts couldn't cover: `_apply_drawdown` caps each draw at the account balance and returns partial coverage, and the leftover was dropped with no record. Worse, `confidence`/`runs_out_year` key only off **total** balance ≤ 0, so the **locked-money case** — spending the plan can't fund while a pension below its access age keeps compounding — reported green **"On track"** on money that could never be spent (the exact failure item 65 warned about).
    - **Engine** (`src/api/routes/projection.py`): `_simulate_run` Phase A now records `year_unfunded = max(0, shortfall − EF draw − Σ drawdown draws)` (GROSS — "couldn't draw enough to meet spending", separate from the Phase-C tax on what *was* drawn; distinct from `runs_out_year`). New per-year `"unfunded"` field on each year dict; new `total_unfunded` + `first_unfunded_year` on the `_simulate_run` and `run_projection` returns. **Confidence override**: any unfunded year forces `confidence="red"`, label **"Spending unfunded"**, message naming the first year + total, with a "balances remain locked in accounts not yet available to draw" clause when `runs_out_year is None`. This branch takes precedence over the existing green/amber/red runs-out logic.
    - **Parity preserved**: with no unfunded year, `year_unfunded` is 0 everywhere, `total_unfunded=0`, `first_unfunded_year=None`, the confidence branch is skipped, and balances/draws/tax are untouched → byte-identical. Verified: Mark's real plan still £2,133,952 / "On track", every year dict carries `unfunded=0`.
    - **UI** (`src/templates/projection.html`): the Table tab gains an **Unfunded** column rendered **only when `projection.first_unfunded_year` is set** (healthy plans are visually unchanged — no extra column); unfunded rows highlighted `bg-error/10`, the unfunded cell `text-error`. The existing confidence card already styles `red` (🔴 + error colours) so the new label/message render with no card change. `downloadCashflowCsv()` reads the rendered cells, so CSV picks up the column automatically — no JS change.
    - **Drawdown sandbox** (`src/api/routes/drawdown.py`): `POST /api/drawdown/preview` JSON now carries `total_unfunded` + `first_unfunded_year`; the page's confidence card already shows the message via `confidence_message`.
    - **Consumers checked**: `run_monte_carlo` reads only `result["years"][*]["balance"]`, so the added keys are harmless there — BUT MC's `success_rate` still keys off balance>0 only, so it does **not** yet count unfunded/locked-money runs as failures (logged as the top backlog item).
    - **Verified (16 checks, all pass)** via direct engine probes + FastAPI `TestClient` on isolated copies: parity on Mark's plan; a constructed locked-money scenario (all investments `drawdownMinAge=90` → cash exhausts ~2031 while ~£11.9M stays locked) correctly flips from the *old* false "On track, £11.9M remaining" to **red "Spending unfunded from 2031 — £3,532,550 unfunded, balances locked"**; `/projection` + `/drawdown-strategy` both render 200; Unfunded column + row highlight present only when relevant; preview JSON carries the new keys. `httpx` was `pip install`ed for `TestClient` then **uninstalled** (`requirements.txt` still has none, per item 50).
    - **Definition choices / not-done**: unfunded is GROSS (didn't fold in the after-tax gross-up nuance — a separate, smaller concern, noted in the engine comment). Single-cut UI: confidence message + Table column; did not add a separate standalone banner (the red card is prominent enough).

## Changes in session 10 (2026-06-05)

_No code changes — an **automated smoke test** of the three session-9 drawdown features (items 57–59). Driven against an **isolated copy** of the live store (`cp -R` of `~/Library/Application Support/MyRetirementLife/store` → `/tmp/mrl-smoke/data`); the live data graph was never opened (verified: `CURRENT` mtime unchanged). Tested in one process via FastAPI's `TestClient` (no port, no store-lock contention) plus direct `run_projection()` engine probes. `httpx` was temporarily `pip install`ed into `.venv` for `TestClient`, then **uninstalled** — `requirements.txt` deliberately still has no `httpx` (per item 50). Harness kept at `/tmp/mrl-smoke/harness.py`._

60. **Automated smoke test — session-9 drawdown features. 25/25 checks pass.**
    - **Drawdown Strategy page (`/drawdown-strategy`)**: GET 200 with Recompute button, vendored `Sortable.min.js`, chart canvas, account list + tax dropdown. **`POST /api/drawdown/preview` is non-persisting** — sent a reordering payload, confirmed `InvestmentAccount_2` `drawdownPriority` unchanged in the store afterward (12→12). **`POST /api/drawdown/save`** returns `ok` + PRG redirect to `?saved=1`, writes the reorder (priority→1), and `?saved=1` shows the saved banner. **Save round-trips tax rates** — confirmed `InvestmentAccount_5`'s 0.20 `effectiveWithdrawalTaxRate` survives a save (0.2→0.2). **Caught a test-only gotcha** (not a product bug): `update_account_drawdown` deletes-then-conditionally-reinserts the five drawdown/tax predicates, so a save payload with `effective_rate: 0` **wipes** the stored rate. The real page pre-fills `effective_withdrawal_tax_rate*100` / `annual_tax_free_withdrawal` / `drawdown_ratio` into the inputs (drawdown_strategy.html:105,111,117) and the JS reads them back, so genuine saves preserve them — but any future change that stops pre-filling would silently zero everyone's tax. Verified via the round-trip assertion above.
    - **ADR-018 mandatory/RMD withdrawal**: "age **with no rate**" (`MS 401(k)`, age 75) is **still eligible at age 80** (`_is_eligible` no longer blocks on upper age — no stranding) and is **byte-identical to removing the age entirely** (true no-op). "age **with a rate**": at 4% the floor applies (2047 draw ≥ 4% of prior balance); at a binding 25% the forced 2047 draw jumps **£118k→£683k**, is **taxed that year (£26k→£150k)**, early-window (age 75–85) throughput rises **£1.60M→£2.65M**, and the final balance correctly collapses **£2.13M→£100k** (forced decumulation out of a high-growth pot into low-growth cash). **NB on Mark's data a realistic ~4% rate is nearly non-binding** (he already draws faster than 4%) — only shifts timing. Note for future tests: **lifetime** totals (cumulative withdrawals, total tax) can *fall* under an aggressive RMD because draining a compounding pot early reduces lifetime throughput — assert **per-year** invariants (the forced draw + the tax in that year), not lifetime sums.
    - **ADR-019 emergency fund + Table tab**: parity exact when unset (engine byte-identical to baseline). **Fill-first**: in a surplus year the EF account is topped up ahead of the overflow target (EF bal 2027 £4k→£10.7k with EF on). **Draw-first**: drawn first in the 2028 shortfall, before the waterfall touches other accounts. But **Mark's plan has only 2 surplus years (2026–27)** so the fund never reaches its months-of-spend target — correct behaviour, just no surplus to build from. **Table tab** on `/projection`: has the `switchTab('table')` tab + `downloadCashflowCsv()` button, renders **one row per year (39 for Mark's plan)**, retirement row ★-marked.
    - **Not covered (genuine browser-only UX, deferred to a `/run` pass — no code outstanding):** the SortableJS drag gesture itself, the Chart.js chart visually rendering with its Total/Per-account toggle, and the CSV file actually downloading. The endpoints, persistence, and data behind all three are verified.

## Changes in session 9 (2026-06-03)

_Three commits, all themed on **retirement drawdown mechanics**. Verified on isolated store copies (the live data graph was untouched during development) — parity, migration, and the new behaviours were each checked via standalone probes; **not yet end-to-end smoke-tested by Mark in the live app**. One outstanding step from these commits — the ontology reload — was completed at the start of the next working session (live store 1.0.4 → 1.0.7, verified)._

57. **Drawdown Strategy page (`/drawdown-strategy`) — commit `7a4a7eb`.** A live sandbox that shows every account's drawdown order and tax treatment together, so the user can see and tune the decumulation plan in one place rather than inferring it from per-account forms.
    - **Engine** (`src/api/routes/projection.py`): `run_projection()` gains a **parity-safe** `account_overrides` param. With `account_overrides=None` (the default, and every existing caller) the projection is byte-identical to before — the override path only activates for the page's preview.
    - **Route** (`src/api/routes/drawdown.py`, new ~246-line module): `GET` page; `POST /api/drawdown/preview` runs a **non-persisting** projection with the sandbox's ordering/tax overrides applied (no write to the store); `POST /api/drawdown/save` persists ordering + tax treatments + strategy. A targeted `update_account_drawdown()` rewrites only the five drawdown/tax predicates per account, leaving balance/name/eligibility triples untouched.
    - **Template** (`src/templates/drawdown_strategy.html`, new ~553 lines): drag-to-reorder (vendored `src/static/vendor/Sortable.min.js`, offline-first — same pattern as `chart.umd.min.js`), inline tax edits, a manual **Recompute** button that calls the preview endpoint, and a withdrawals-over-time Chart.js chart (Total / Per-account toggle + a tax line).
    - Wired in via `src/templates/base.html` (nav link) and `src/api/app.py` (router registration).

58. **ADR-018 — mandatory (RMD-style) withdrawal age; retire the drawdown cutoff — commit `2b04d40`.** Surfaced while testing the new Drawdown Strategy page. `mrl:drawdownMaxAge` (ADR-011) was a **hard cutoff**: past the age, `_is_eligible()` returned `False` and the account became undrawable. A US 401(k) capped at 75 therefore stopped funding spending from age 75 — and because the engine does not record an uncovered shortfall, it silently drew nothing while the ~£3M pot compounded untouched to ~£9M, so the projection reported "On track" on money it said could never be spent.
    - **Redefined** as the age withdrawals must **start** (forced decumulation, RMD pattern), with a user-set % per account. User-set percentage chosen over deplete-over-life or the IRS Uniform Lifetime Table because it's jurisdiction-neutral (the tool spans countries) and simple to reason about.
    - **Ontology 1.0.5 → 1.0.6** (`docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl`): + `mrl:mandatoryWithdrawalAge` (decimal), + `mrl:mandatoryWithdrawalRate` (decimal); `mrl:drawdownMaxAge` **deprecated-in-place** (retained on the class so pre-1.0.6 data migrates). Needs `tools/reload_ontology.py`.
    - **Engine** (`projection.py`): `_is_eligible()` no longer consults `drawdownMaxAge`; min-age / earliest-date / latest-date eligibility unchanged. Step 7 restructured into phases — **A** cover shortfall, **B** force RMD minimums (`balance × rate%`, counting any shortfall draw already taken that year), **C** tax all draws once (ADR-013 two-layer model), **D** sweep after-tax forced surplus to the spending account via the existing surplus-routing fallback. Migration helper copies legacy `drawdownMaxAge → mandatoryWithdrawalAge` (rate left unset) on load (in `run_projection`, GET accounts, GET drawdown-strategy).
    - **Read/write/Form plumbing**: `accounts.py`, `investments.py`, `accounts.html` (field relabelled "Maximum access age" → "Mandatory withdrawal age" + a rate % field, with help text); `settings_route.py` export/restore carries the two new fields; `drawdown_strategy.html` eligibility chip shows "RMD X%/yr from age Y".
    - **Verified on isolated store copies**: parity exact with no rate set (engine output byte-identical to the old engine — final, tax, runs-out, every per-account withdrawal); migration un-strands the 401(k) (final £9.2M → £3.35M usable) and is idempotent; RMD forces draws, taxes them, sweeps after-tax net to spending; form save, RMD chip, backup round-trip, and legacy-backup migration all pass.
    - **Carried-forward concern (not decided here):** the engine still does not flag a spending shortfall it cannot fund from eligible accounts. Removing the cutoff makes this far less likely to bite, but a "spending unfunded from year N" signal remains a worthwhile follow-on.

59. **ADR-019 — emergency fund + year-by-year cashflow table — commit `5e0741a`.** The emergency fund was surfaced by the Jamie Smith scenario, where cash accounts never built a buffer (routed income offsets spending as cashflow; surplus is swept to investments) and were wiped by the first deficit year — after which shortfalls were met by liquidating investments. No way to model the everyday-finance staple of a cash buffer you build up and draw on first.
    - **Ontology 1.0.6 → 1.0.7** (`docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl`): + `mrl:emergencyFundAccount` (object → `mrl:Account`), + `mrl:emergencyFundMonths` (decimal) on `mrl:ProjectionSettings`. Target = `months / 12 × recurring_spend` (mandatory + discretionary + loan budget; one-off life events excluded) — months-of-spending chosen over a fixed amount so the buffer auto-scales with inflation and budget changes. Needs `tools/reload_ontology.py`.
    - **Engine** (`projection.py` `_simulate_run`): the designated fund is **filled first** each year — a `sweep()` helper tops it up to target before overflowing to the surplus account, used for both the normal surplus sweep and the after-tax RMD proceeds (ADR-018) — and **drawn first** in a shortfall year, ahead of the Waterfall/Proportional strategy, subject to `_is_eligible` and a positive balance.
    - **Plumbing**: `get_/save_projection_settings` + all round-trip callers + backup export/restore (`settings_route.py`) carry the two new settings; `POST /projection/settings` gains the Form params; `projection.html` settings form gains the Emergency fund account + months fields.
    - **Year-by-year table** (new "Table" tab on `/projection`, `projection.html`): server-rendered from the existing `run_projection` output (no new computation) — columns Year · Income · Spending · Growth · Tax · Total, then one column per account (blue dot = `CashAccount`, green otherwise), retirement row highlighted with ★, `table-pin-rows` header, client-side "Download CSV" via `downloadCashflowCsv()`.
    - **Verified on isolated store copies**: parity exact — no emergency fund set ⇒ engine byte-identical to the ADR-018 engine (final, tax, runs-out, balances, per-account withdrawals); EF fills to the 6-month target then overflows, and is drawn first on the 2030 spike; settings UI pre-selects, POST persists, backup round-trips; table renders 57 rows with correct figures + CSV.
    - **Future refinements noted in the ADR:** the fund is a single account (no split-across-accounts), and a fixed-amount target alternative — both deferred.

## Changes in session 8 (2026-06-01)

_Shipped in commit **`127953b`** — "Engine + UX fixes: routed income, windfall sign, retirement star marker" (items 54–56). Three independent fixes that surfaced while debugging a 36-year-old's plan (Jamie Smith scenario): pension drawing down at age 36, savings account being credited and debited in the same year, inheritance windfall showing as a debit, retirement-year ★ missing from the per-account chart. Not yet end-to-end smoke-tested by Mark — the engine change was verified directly via a standalone probe (`run_projection` on Jamie's live data graph), and the Windfall sign fix verified via code inspection of the duplicate-form selector bug._

54. **Engine: routed income to the effective spending account now flows through `pre_net`.** Closes the open consideration documented in item 24 of this CLAUDE_CONTEXT — when an income source's `deposit_account` equals the projection's spending account, the engine credits the income to that account's balance but, in pre-1.0.6, did not recognise it as covering this year's spending. `pre_net` went negative every year and drawdown was triggered against every eligible account at the same priority. With Jamie's data (£37k salary routed to Main Current at default priority 999, alongside a £350+£700 payroll-pension contribution attached — by data-entry error — to Personal Savings at the same priority, with the pension's `drawdownMinAge` unset → eligible at age 36), the symptom was THREE compounding issues:
    - Pension drawn down immediately because no `drawdownMinAge` was set (user-fixable: set to 57 for UK).
    - Personal Savings credited £12,600/yr by the contribution AND withdrawn £11–20k/yr by drawdown, exhausted by year 5.
    - Main Current Account growing strongly with surplus that was also being drawn down because the engine didn't see the income as covering spending.
    - **Fix (projection.py `_simulate_run()`):** new module-local `_resolve_effective_spending()` helper at the top of the function. Resolves the effective surplus target via the same fallback chain the surplus routing already uses: configured `spending_account_label` → first `CashAccountType_Current` → first cash account → first account. Income loop condition changed from `if deposit and deposit in balances:` to `if deposit and deposit in balances and deposit != effective_spending:`. When equal → falls into the unrouted branch → flows through `pre_net` → spending is covered first, only surplus credits the account (via the existing surplus routing path, which still targets the same account).
    - **Why the effective fallback (not just `spending_acc`):** the user's first attempt was to compare against `spending_acc` only. Verified live that Jamie's `spending_account_label` was `None` (user hadn't saved projection settings yet); the comparison `"CashAccount_1" != None` evaluated `True` and the fix was a no-op. Catching the dominant first-load case requires following the same fallback the surplus router already uses — anything less leaves new users with the same trap.
    - **Verified live** on Jamie's data via standalone probe (`run_projection` against the running store): Personal Savings now grows £5k → £117k over 8 years with zero withdrawals; Main Current grows £1.8k → £119k from surplus; Workplace Pension untouched (the user's own `drawdownMinAge=57` fix). Pre-existing scenarios where `deposit_account` targets a different account from the effective spending target are unchanged.
    - `src/templates/income.html`: "How the deposit account affects your projection" panel rewritten to describe the new behaviour. Now distinguishes "deposit ≠ spending" (routed, drawdown trap still applies) from "deposit == spending" (treated as cashflow, no trap) from "leave unset" (default unrouted behaviour).
    - **Open consideration carried forward**: when `deposit_account ≠ effective_spending`, the original routing-vs-drawdown trap still exists — by design (the user is explicitly opting in by routing to a non-spending account). On Jamie's data the divergence ran into millions over the 50-year horizon. The on-page help text (and CHANGELOG entry) flags this; a future refinement might either (a) prevent priority-999 deposit accounts via UI validation, or (b) auto-set drawdown_priority=1 on accounts that receive routed income.

55. **Life events: Windfall sign was being stored as cost.** The engine convention (set up in `projection.py` year-loop step 5) is `amount >= 0 → cost`, `amount < 0 → receipt`. The add/edit form already had a client-side JS submit-handler that negated the amount when type was `Windfall`/`AssetSale`. But the selector `document.querySelector('form[action*="life-events"]')` returned the FIRST matching form — the per-row delete form at `life_events.html:100` — so the handler attached to the wrong form and **never fired on save**. Windfall amounts went into the data graph positive, and the engine read them as costs. Mark's new £65k inheritance in 2055 surfaced in the projection as a £65k DEBIT against Workplace Pension instead of a credit.
    - **Two-layer fix:**
      - `src/templates/life_events.html`: add/edit form gains `id="life-event-form"`; JS changed from `document.querySelector('form[action*="life-events"]')` to `document.getElementById('life-event-form')`. Now finds the right form regardless of how many sibling delete-forms exist.
      - `src/api/routes/life_events.py`: new module constant `RECEIPT_EVENT_TYPES = {"LifeEventType_Windfall", "LifeEventType_AssetSale"}` and `_normalise_event_amount(amount, event_type)` helper. Forces sign based on event type: receipts → negative, everything else → positive. Both `POST /life-events` and `POST /life-events/{n}/edit` route handlers wrap `lifeEventAmount` through the normaliser before calling `save_event()`. Authoritative — any future client-side bug can't corrupt the sign of stored events.
    - **Repairing existing wrong-sign rows:** open the row in edit, click Save with no other changes — the server-side normaliser rewrites the amount with the correct sign. The pre-filled value is already `abs(amount)` (the form template handles that), so the displayed magnitude is correct.

56. **Per-account chart: retirement-year ★ marker was disappearing.** Mark spotted the legend at the bottom of the per-account "Annual growth earned vs drawdown taken" chart saying "★ = retirement year" but no star was visible on the chart. Root cause: `investment_projection.html:127` rendered the star via the X-axis tick callback (`fmtYear(year) → year === retirementYear ? \`${year} ★\` : ...`). Chart.js's `autoSkip` thins ticks based on POSITION SPACING, not label content — so the retirement-year tick was being dropped along with every other non-multiple-of-5 tick whenever the canvas didn't have room for them all. On Jamie's plan the visible tick labels were 2035, 2050, 2065, 2080; retirement at 2057 fell into a gap and the ★ vanished.
    - **Fix (investment_projection.html:179–202):** plot the star as a real data-series point on the balance-line dataset instead of relying on the axis label. The balance line's `pointRadius`, `pointHoverRadius`, `pointStyle`, and `pointBorderWidth` are now per-point arrays driven by `years.map(y => y === retirementYear ? <marker-config> : <invisible>)`. The retirement year shows as a 7-radius star in indigo; every other year stays radius-0 as before. The X-axis tick `★` fallback in `fmtYear` is kept as belt-and-braces but the data-point marker is the authoritative indicator.
    - **Templates affected by the same root-cause but NOT fixed in this commit:** `projection.html:600,860,992`, `budget.html:684`, `dashboard.html:464` all use the same `if (y === retirementYear) return \`${y} ★\`` tick-callback pattern. They'll show the same disappearing-star symptom when the retirement year doesn't survive autoSkip. Different chart shapes (stacked-area for the main projection, mixed line+bar for the budget chart, stacked-area on the dashboard) so the fix isn't a verbatim copy of the investment-projection one — each chart needs a marker anchored to a real series point appropriate to its data layout. Tracked as a follow-on; not yet started.

## Changes in session 7 (2026-05-30)

_Session 7 — shipped in commit **`585e786`** — "ADR-016 follow-on: per-line budget currency + inline live FX buttons" (items 50–53). End-to-end smoke-tested by Mark across all three pages (inline buttons populate live, bulk refresh works, per-line budget currency rolls up correctly in chart + projection, backup/restore round-trips income FX + deposit account)._

50. **Shared `GET /api/fx/rate?code=XYZ` JSON endpoint.** Single live-rate lookup used by all three inline buttons (accounts, income, budget) so the per-row "Use live rate" UX doesn't need a page reload. Returns `{ok: True, code, rate_to_base, as_of, provider}` on success, `{ok: False, error: "..."}` with a 4xx/5xx status on failure. Lives in `src/api/routes/accounts.py` (the existing FX hub — already had bulk refresh and `_update_account_rate`). Uses the same `1 / rate_provider[code]` convention as the bulk refresh, with a 1.0 short-circuit when the asked-for code equals the base. Same-origin only; no auth needed (app is local-first).
    - **Why one JSON endpoint instead of three per-page POSTs:** the bulk refresh routes are HTML-rendering (they re-render the page with a banner). The inline button just needs to populate two fields. JSON keeps the JS simple and avoids three near-identical handlers.
    - **No new dependency** on httpx in the runtime — the `TestClient` import in `fastapi.testclient` requires it, so I couldn't end-to-end test from the dev shell; the logic mirrors the proven bulk refresh path so the parity argument carries.

51. **Inline "Use live rate" button on accounts + income edit forms.** Adds a small button next to the FX rate input that calls `/api/fx/rate?code=...` and populates the rate + date in-place. Failure modes (offline, no rate for code, base currency not set) surface a one-line warning hint and leave the existing rate untouched. Mark wanted this because the bulk "Refresh rates" button updates everything at once; sometimes you only want one row's rate while editing it. Pattern is identical across both pages so the JS is copy-pasted with the right element IDs.
    - `src/templates/accounts.html`: button + spinner + hint span added next to `name="exchangeRateToBase"`; `pullLiveRate()` JS handler appended to the existing FX-visibility script block. Works for all three account classes (cash + investment + asset) because they share one form and one FX field.
    - `src/templates/income.html`: same pattern; reads `data-code` from the currency `<option>` (the dropdown already carried it for the visibility toggle). Updates the hidden `incomeExchangeRateDate` input as well as the visible rate input, and rewrites the "Last updated …" pill if it's present.

52. **Per-line currency + FX + live refresh on budget (1.0.5 — ADR-016 follow-on).** Until this session, budget lines were assumed to be in the user's base currency — there was no way to model a USD mortgage or a EUR subscription. This change adds the same currency + FX model that accounts and income already had.
    - **Ontology 1.0.4 → 1.0.5** (`docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl`): three new properties on `mrl:BudgetLine` — `budgetLineCurrency` (object property → `mrl:Currency`, optional, defaults to base at read time), `budgetLineExchangeRateToBase` (decimal, "1 unit of line currency = N units of base"), `budgetLineExchangeRateDate` (date). FX-rate convention identical to `mrl:exchangeRateToBase` on accounts and `mrl:incomeExchangeRateToBase` on income sources. Requires `python tools/reload_ontology.py` (app closed) before the property declarations appear in the live store, though backend writes don't depend on them.
    - **Backend** (`src/api/routes/budget.py`):
      - `get_all_budget_lines()` now reads `currency`/`currencyCode`/`currencySymbol`/`exchangeRate`/`exchangeRateDate` and surfaces them on each line dict.
      - `save_budget_line_segments()` takes three new kwargs (`currency_local`, `exchange_rate`, `exchange_rate_date`); writes `mrl:budgetLineCurrency` always (defaults to person's base if blank), and writes the rate pair only when ≠ 1.0 — matches accounts/income persistence convention.
      - New `_update_budget_line_rate()` helper (mirrors `_update_account_rate` / `_update_income_rate`) wipes + rewrites just the two FX-rate triples per line.
      - New `POST /budget/refresh-rates` route — bulk refresh over every cross-currency line in one pass; renders the budget page with the same `rate_refresh_*` context the accounts/income pages use.
      - `_sum_lines_per_year()` and `compute_annual_spending_series()` now pre-multiply each segment's `annualAmount` by `_line_fx(line)` so multi-currency lines roll up correctly on the by-category, by-line, and M/D/L breakdowns. Defaults to 1.0 for absent/invalid rates, so pre-1.0.5 lines are bit-identical.
      - `_page_context` exposes `currencies`, `base_currency`, and `today` for the form template.
      - Both `POST /budget` and `POST /budget/{n}/edit` gain `budgetLineCurrency` / `budgetLineExchangeRateToBase` / `budgetLineExchangeRateDate` Form params and pass them through.
    - **Engine** (`src/api/routes/projection.py` `load_budget_lines()`): pre-multiplies each segment's `annual_amount` by the line's `budgetLineExchangeRateToBase` (default 1.0). Same FX-at-load pattern used for accounts (`load_all_accounts`) and income (`load_all_income_sources`); downstream year-loop sees base-currency figures only. **Parity preserved**: pre-1.0.5 lines have no FX triple → 1.0 → identical numbers.
    - **Template** (`src/templates/budget.html`):
      - New rate-refresh banner block at top (mirrors accounts/income).
      - Budget-lines card header gains a "Refresh rates" button + "Live rates from open.er-api.com" pill.
      - Annual-total cell in the lines table shows the line's own currency symbol, then a small sub-line with `{code} @ {rate} → {base equivalent}` when the line currency differs from base.
      - Add/edit form gains a Currency dropdown (defaults to base) and a conditional Exchange-rate field with the same inline "Use live rate" button + hidden date input pattern used on the other two pages.
    - **Export/restore** (`src/api/routes/settings_route.py`): `budget_lines` export adds `currency` / `exchangeRate` / `exchangeRateDate`; restore writes the currency triple when present and the FX-rate pair only when ≠ 1.0 (matches the save path). Pre-1.0.5 backups round-trip cleanly: no currency triple is written and the engine falls back to base at load.

53. **Income export/restore round-trip — fixed.** Same session, after item 52 surfaced the gap. The income source export had been missing four fields since they were introduced: `incomeCurrency` and `incomeExchangeRate*` (added 2026-05-23, item 11) and `creditedToAccount` (added 2026-05-25, item 24). Backups silently dropped them, so a restore wiped every cross-currency income source back to base + every deposit-account routing back to the default surplus path — material outcome changes for any plan with foreign-currency income or routed income. Now mirrored on the budget pattern from item 52: export adds the four fields, restore emits the FX-rate pair only when ≠ 1.0, the currency triple when present, and the `creditedToAccount` link when set. Pre-fix backups still restore cleanly — missing fields just fall back to the engine defaults (base currency, unrouted income). No ontology change needed; the properties have existed since 2026-05-23.

## Changes in session 6 (2026-05-30)

_Session 6 changes (items 48 + 49) — packaging shipped in commit **`18cafb3`**, pywebview integration in commit **`f489261`**._

48. **macOS packaging: PyInstaller `.app` + `.dmg` distributable.** Implements the ADR-002 strategy that had been documented but not built. New `tools/MyRetirementLife.spec` bundles `src/templates`, `src/static`, and `docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl` with explicit hidden imports for the API route modules and uvicorn's dynamic loaders (`uvicorn.loops.auto`, `uvicorn.protocols.http.h11_impl`, etc.). `src/config.py` already handled `sys._MEIPASS` so no source changes were needed. New `tools/build_mac.sh` cleans `build/` + `dist/`, runs PyInstaller, then `hdiutil create -format UDZO` against a stage dir containing the `.app` plus an `Applications` symlink so the DMG has the standard drag-to-install affordance. `VERSION` env var stamps the DMG filename (default `dev`). Build deps moved to a separate `requirements-build.txt` (just `pyinstaller~=6.11`) to keep them out of the runtime install. `.gitignore` keeps the `*.spec` wildcard but adds `!tools/MyRetirementLife.spec` so the committed spec is tracked while PyInstaller's auto-generated ones at the repo root stay ignored. README gains a "Building a macOS distributable" section with the Gatekeeper note pointing at ADR-002.
    - **Build machine note:** PyInstaller cannot cross-compile — current build targets arm64 only (the build machine arch). Universal2 deferred per ADR-002.
    - **Gatekeeper / Sequoia (15.0+) discovery:** the right-click → Open bypass that ADR-002 documents was **removed** in Sequoia. Recipients now get "Move to Bin" only; the workarounds are System Settings → Privacy & Security → "Open Anyway", or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/My Retirement Life.app"`. Code-signing + notarisation (Apple Developer ID, $99/yr) remain the proper fix — still deferred to v1.0. ADR-002's "right-click → Open" wording is stale; update if/when the ADR is revised.
    - **Smoke-test caveat to remember:** the packaged build and a running `python main.py` dev server share the same per-user `DATA_DIR` and so contend for the Oxigraph store lock (`~/Library/Application Support/MyRetirementLife/store/LOCK`). If both run at once, whichever loses the race crashes with `OSError: ... lock file ... Resource temporarily unavailable`. Not a packaging bug — same as two dev servers. When smoke-testing the packaged `.app` without killing the dev server, override both: `APP_PORT=8765 DATA_DIR=/tmp/mrl-smoke/data "./dist/My Retirement Life.app/Contents/MacOS/MyRetirementLife"`.
    - **Build artifacts:** 64M `.app`, 31M DMG (well under ADR-002's 80–150M ceiling).

49. **Native desktop window via pywebview — replaces "open in default browser".** Mark wanted the packaged app to feel like a real desktop app, not a Chrome tab. Chose pywebview over Electron/Tauri after architectural discussion: the webview is just a window manager around `localhost:8000`, the FastAPI + HTMX architecture stays unchanged, no Xcode / Node / Rust needed. Tauri also uses each OS's webview so it doesn't escape the three-engine split — only Electron does (by shipping Chromium), and the bundle-size + toolchain tax isn't worth it for this app. Mental model: a future "My Financial Life" sister app's larger datasets and richer interactivity won't be bottlenecked by the webview either — the real architecture decisions for that app would be SQLite-vs-Oxigraph for transaction-heavy data, and pure-HTMX vs HTMX + interactive islands for grid-style UX. Window shell is swappable later (`main.py` is the only file that knows about it).
    - **`main.py`** rewritten: uvicorn now runs in a daemon thread; main thread waits on `/health` (15s timeout via `urlopen`) then calls `webview.create_window(title=settings.app_name, url=..., width=1400, height=900, min_size=(900,600), resizable=True)` + `webview.start()` (blocking). `webview.start()` must be on the main thread on macOS — Cocoa requirement. When the window closes, the process exits and the daemon thread is torn down with it. Eager `from src.api.app import app` before starting the thread surfaces any import-time failure on the main thread instead of silently inside the worker.
    - **`requirements.txt`** gains `pywebview>=5.4` plus platform-conditional deps via `sys_platform` markers: `pyobjc-core`, `pyobjc-framework-Cocoa`, `pyobjc-framework-WebKit` on Darwin; `pythonnet>=3.0` on Win32. Installed pywebview 6.2.1 + pyobjc-core 12.1 in the venv.
    - **`tools/MyRetirementLife.spec`** adds `webview.platforms.cocoa` to `hiddenimports` so the Cocoa backend is always bundled (pyinstaller-hooks-contrib usually picks it up, but explicit is safer against future hook changes).
    - **Verified:** dev run (`python main.py`) and packaged `.app` both open a native WKWebView window with the dashboard rendered inside (logs show `GET /` plus every static asset returning 200 to the window's request context). Bundle 64M → 66M, DMG 31M → 33M. `dist/` was rebuilt after the pywebview changes; no further build needed before distributing.
    - **Windows + Linux next steps:** `main.py` change is platform-agnostic. Windows packaging will need a sibling `tools/build_windows.ps1` plus likely a separate `.spec` with `webview.platforms.winforms` or `edgechromium` as the explicit hidden import (WebView2 runtime is preinstalled on Win10/11). Linux deferred per Mark.

## Changes in session 5 (2026-05-30)

_Shipped in commit **`56d2da9`** — "Form-reset UX: PRG remaining edit handlers (accounts/investments/income)" (item 47)._

47. **PRG fix applied to the four remaining edit handlers.** Mark reported that saving an edit on a cash account left the form populated with no clear confirmation — the very same symptom session 4 fixed for budget. CLAUDE_CONTEXT item 45 had explicitly flagged accounts/investments/income edit handlers as still on the old stay-populated pattern. This session closes that gap.
    - `src/api/routes/accounts.py`: `GET /accounts` now also accepts `?saved=1`; `POST /accounts/{n}/edit` and `POST /accounts/asset/{label}/edit` both 303-redirect to `/accounts?saved=1` instead of re-rendering with `edit_account=…, saved=True`.
    - `src/api/routes/investments.py`: `POST /investments/{n}/edit` 303-redirects to `/accounts?saved=1` (investments share the unified accounts template per item 21).
    - `src/api/routes/income.py`: `GET /income` accepts `?added=1`/`?saved=1`. **Income add also fixed while there** — it had been a `TemplateResponse` re-render with `saved=True` (form happened to be blank because no `edit_source` was passed, but F5 would resubmit). Both `POST /income` and `POST /income/{n}/edit` now redirect properly (to `/income?added=1` and `/income?saved=1` respectively). `RedirectResponse` added to the imports line.
    - `src/templates/income.html`: added an `{% if added %}` banner above the existing `{% if saved %}` banner, matching the accounts/budget two-banner pattern.
    - `accounts.html` already had both `added` and `saved` banners from prior work — no template change needed there.
    - **Memory rule already in place** (from session 4): _every save (add + edit) should PRG to a blank form + "saved" banner; never leave a populated form_. This session applied that rule across the remaining handlers; no new memory written.
    - **Also debugged** during the session: a Chrome "Invalid value" balloon on the `drawdownLatestDate` HTML5 date input when typing dates by keyboard (the field has zero validation in our code — confirmed by grep). Root cause was Chrome's segment-by-segment parser rejecting transient partial-year states; picker works fine. No code change made — left as a known browser quirk. If users hit it often, a defensive `min`/`max` on the two `<input type="date">` fields would bound the year segment.

## Changes in session 4 (2026-05-29)

_Shipped in commit **`a281e34`** — "Form-reset UX + scenario/backup PhysicalAsset coverage" (items 45 + 46)._

45. **Add forms reset after save (post/redirect/get); edit too.** Mark reported that after saving an Add (account / budget line) the fields stayed populated and it wasn't clear it had saved. Root cause: `add_account`/`add_investment_account` 303-redirected to `/accounts/{n}/edit` (populated + the `/edit` scroll-to-form JS fired). Fixed: add handlers now PRG to `/accounts?added=1` (and `/budget?added=1`); the index GETs read the flag and show an `{% if added %}` "added and saved — form below is ready for the next one" banner over a blank form. Then Mark flagged that **adding a stage to an existing budget line** (the edit path) still stayed populated — so `save_edit_budget_line` now also PRGs to `/budget?saved=1` (blank form + "saved" banner; the persisted line with its new stage count is visible in the list). **This supersedes item 38's "stay in edit mode after save" for budget.** Memory updated: every save (add + edit) should land on a clean form + clear banner, never a populated form. (accounts/investments/income **edit** handlers still use the old stay-populated pattern — apply the same PRG fix if Mark hits them.)

46. **Scenario/backup save now includes PhysicalAssets — was silently deleting them.** Mark asked whether "save scenario" persists everything recent. Audit found `export_all_data()` only queried `CashAccount` + `InvestmentAccount`, never `PhysicalAsset`. Because `restore_all_data()` wipes the whole data graph (`DELETE WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`) before re-inserting, loading any scenario/backup **permanently deleted every property/vehicle/collectible** (and its appreciation rate, sale year/value, proceeds-account link). Fixed: `export_all_data()` now emits a `physical_assets` list (iterating `ASSET_SUBCLASSES`, lazily imported from accounts.py) and `restore_all_data()` recreates `mrl:{subclass}_{n}` after the cash/investment accounts (so `assetProceedsAccount` targets exist), mirroring `save_asset()`. Export schema → 0.3.1. Verified with an isolated in-memory-store export→wipe→restore→export round-trip (all asset fields intact, other entities preserved). Confirmed already-covered: employer contributions, payroll flag, budget stages/segments, account types/tax/drawdown.

## Changes in session 3 (2026-05-28)

_Shipped in commit **`5a98682`** — "ADR-015 v1.2: payroll/salary-sacrifice flag + contributions on add form" (items 43 + 44)._

43. **Contributions can now be added on the new-account form (one step).** Previously the contribution panel only rendered when editing an existing account (`{% if edit_account %}` gate in `accounts.html`), so adding a workplace pension was add-then-edit. Extracted the contribution field grid into a Jinja macro `contrib_fields(contrib, required)` and render it inline in the main add form (wrapped `class-field class-field-cash class-field-invest` so it shows for cash + investment, hides + disables for assets → not submitted). Amount is `required` only in edit mode; add mode parses optionally so accounts can still be created with no contribution. `add_account`/`add_investment_account` gained string-typed contribution Form params + a shared `parse_add_contribution()` helper (in accounts.py, imported by investments.py) that returns save_contribution kwargs or None.

44. **ADR-015 v1.2 — payroll / salary-sacrifice flag (ontology 1.0.4).** Mark's insight: a contribution taken from payroll (occupational pension / salary sacrifice) shouldn't debit net income, because the engine treats entered income as net/take-home (income sources are never taxed — tax is drawdown-only, ADR-013), so debiting it double-counts. New boolean `mrl:contributionFromPayroll`; when true the employee portion behaves cashflow-wise exactly like the employer portion — credits the balance, excluded from `year_contribution_spending` (`projection.py` step 2b) and from `compute_annual_contributions_series` (`budget.py`). UI: checkbox below the employer field. Budget footer now splits three ways: cashflow-counted total (non-payroll employee), payroll subtotal, employer subtotal. Backup/restore round-trips the flag. **Parity:** absent/false → bit-identical to v1.1.

---

## Changes in session 2 (2026-05-27)

_Shipped in commit **`fcdb386`** — "ADR-015 v1.1: employer contribution split + pin numpy" (items 41 + 42)._

41. **Numpy missing in venv — 500 on `/projection`.** On Mark's laptop the project's `.venv` didn't have numpy installed even though it's in `requirements.txt`. Hitting `/projection` after a fresh install with a partial profile bombed at `run_monte_carlo`'s `import numpy as np` (line 1351), which sits BEFORE the early-return guards (`if not profile: return None`; "no investment accounts → return None"). Fixed by `pip install numpy` (got 2.4.6) and pinned `numpy==2.4.6` in `requirements.txt:11` for reproducibility. Considered moving the import below the guards as defensive belt-and-braces — declined as scope creep; numpy is a hard requirement, missing it is an install bug, not a code path to harden.

42. **Employer contributions (ADR-015 v1.1) — DONE end-to-end.** Replaces the originally-deferred `isEmployerContribution` boolean with a per-period `mrl:employerContributionAmount` decimal on the existing `mrl:AccountContribution`. Single contribution row in the UI carries BOTH an employee amount and an optional employer amount; engine credits balance with their sum but only debits cashflow with the employee portion. Chosen over the "multi-row contributions UI + boolean flag" design (originally sketched in ADR-015) because it captures the dominant real-world pattern (one workplace pension with employer match) with one extra field instead of a form rewrite. ADR-015 amended with a v1.1 section documenting the design and the rejected alternative.
    - **Ontology 1.0.2 → 1.0.3** (`docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl`): new property `mrl:employerContributionAmount` (xsd:decimal, domain `mrl:AccountContribution`). Standalone property declaration — the `AccountContribution` class itself is not declared in the TTL (pre-existing oversight; pyoxigraph is schema-less, runtime works regardless). Parses cleanly (1286 → 1291 triples). **Requires `python tools\reload_ontology.py` (app closed)** before the new property declaration appears in the live store, though backend writes don't depend on the declaration.
    - **Backend** (`accounts.py` + `investments.py`): `get_contribution()` now returns `employerAmount` + `employerAnnual`; `save_contribution()` takes a new `employer_amount` kwarg (default 0.0) and writes the triple only when non-zero. Contribution route signatures gain `employerContributionAmount: float = Form(0.0)`. Default behaviour preserved when the field is absent (zero = identical to v1.0).
    - **Engine** (`projection.py`): `load_all_contributions()` returns `employer_annual_amount` alongside `annual_amount`. `_simulate_run()` year-loop step 2b splits the growth factor across employee + employer portions: balance is credited with the sum, `year_contribution_spending` (which becomes a cashflow deduction at `pre_net = ... - year_contribution_spending`) accumulates only the employee portion. `account_contribution_history` records the sum so per-account chart shows total inflow. **Parity preserved**: pre-v1.1 contributions have no `employerContributionAmount` triple → `_float()` defaults to 0.0 → employer portion contributes nothing → bit-identical engine output. MC inherits this automatically (shared `_simulate_run`).
    - **Budget page** (`budget.py` + `budget.html`): `get_all_contributions_for_budget()` exposes `employerAmount` + `employerAnnual`. The read-only "Account contributions" table per-row Amount and Annual-total cells show a small "+ £X employer" sub-line when non-zero; footer separates "Total annual contributions (your portion — counted in cashflow)" from "Employer portion (credits balances, not your cashflow)". `compute_annual_contributions_series()` was NOT modified — it reads `c.get("annualAmount")` which is and always was the employee-only annual. So the chart's "Account contributions" stack stays cashflow-accurate without any function-body change.
    - **UI** (`accounts.html`): "Amount per period" relabelled "Your contribution per period". New full-width field "Employer contribution per period" placed below the Amount/Frequency pair, above Start/End. Help text on the section now distinguishes the two parts. Live annual-equivalent hint (`updateContribAnnual()` JS) shows the split when both are non-zero: "Annual: £X you + £Y employer = £Z total"; falls back to the old single-value hint when employer is zero. Account list table contribution badge now sums employee + employer (with title attribute showing the split) when employer > 0; appends a small `*` glyph as a visual hint that there's a split.
    - **Backup/restore** (`settings_route.py`): contribution export adds `employerAmount` (uses existing `_opt_float`); restore writes the triple when present and non-zero. Old backups without the field round-trip cleanly (treated as zero).
    - **No engine parity verification** done this session — the parity argument is structural (the new `employer_annual_amount` reads as 0.0 from existing data, contributing 0 to every accumulator). If Mark wants belt-and-braces verification: run a projection before reload, restore the same backup, run again — totals should match exactly.

## Changes earlier this session (2026-05-26 → 2026-05-27)

38. **Edit-form UX: stay in edit mode after save + universal scroll-to-form.** Two coupled fixes prompted by a bug report — Mark observed "the end date reverts to infinity" on a budget line and "it's not clear where the editing is supposed to happen as the screen does not switch focus" when clicking Edit on accounts / budget / income. After tracing the end-date save path end-to-end and finding no place where the data could be silently dropped, I concluded the most likely cause was a UX confusion: the POST `/edit` handlers re-rendered with `edit_line=None`, which dropped the form into "Add a budget line" mode showing empty fields — easy to mistake for the saved value reverting.
    - **Stay in edit mode after save.** All five edit POST handlers now re-fetch the just-saved row and pass it back as `edit_line` / `edit_source` / `edit_account` so the form re-renders with the actual persisted state visible. If the end-date bug is real (rather than a UX artefact), this makes it immediately diagnostic — the user sees empty-after-save on the very same form. Affected handlers: `POST /budget/{n}/edit`, `POST /income/{n}/edit`, `POST /accounts/{n}/edit`, `POST /accounts/asset/{label}/edit`, `POST /investments/{n}/edit`.
    - **Universal scroll-to-form on `/edit` URLs.** New script appended to `base.html` (outside `{% block scripts %}` so it inherits everywhere). Runs on any path ending `/edit`. Scrolls the form into view via `scrollIntoView({behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start'})` and calls `.focus({preventScroll: true})` on the first non-hidden/non-readonly/non-disabled input. Targets `#budget-form`, `#income-form`, `#account-form` selectors — added `id="income-form"` to the income template to match (budget and accounts already had IDs from earlier work).
    - **Note for next session — diagnostic path if the bug is real**: if Mark reports that AFTER the stay-in-edit-mode fix he still sees the end-year field empty on the form after saving, that's a real persistence bug. I traced the path in detail — `_segments_from_form` correctly preserves the string, `save_budget_line_segments` correctly converts it to int and forwards to `save_segment`, `save_segment` correctly writes `mrl:segmentEndYear "{year}"^^xsd:integer` to the data graph, `get_segments_for_line`'s `gv("segmentEndYear")` correctly returns the lexical form. Inspection didn't find a bug. If it persists, add a print/log to `save_budget_line_segments` showing `segments` arg, and to `get_segments_for_line` showing the read-back dict. Then have Mark reproduce.

37. **Budget chart — inflation toggle (loan-aware).** Follow-on to Phase 3 after Mark observed the chart staying flat over time. New "With inflation (X.X%/yr)" checkbox on the chart card sits next to the Category/Line toggle; default off (real terms — preserves Phase 3 behaviour). When on, the chart shows nominal £ — non-loan lines lifted by `(1 + inflation/100)^years_from_start`, loan-type lines kept fixed-nominal (matches the projection engine's loan treatment so the budget chart and projection page agree on the same numbers).
    - `budget.py`: `_sum_lines_per_year()`, `compute_annual_contributions_series()`, `compute_annual_spending_by_category()`, and `compute_annual_spending_by_line()` all gain an `inflation_rate: float = 0.0` parameter. `_page_context` now lazy-imports `get_projection_settings` (fallback 2.5% inflation) and precomputes four chart shapes — `chart_series = {by_category: {real, nominal}, by_line: {real, nominal}}`. Loans use only their `segmentChangeRate`; non-loans add `inflation_rate + segmentChangeRate` per year. Contributions inflate too (they're future cash commitments).
    - `budget.html`: chart card header gains the inflation checkbox; the dataset key on the chart `{{ chart_series | tojson }}` replaces the old `{{ by_category | tojson }}` + `{{ by_line | tojson }}` pair. JS tracks two state booleans (`currentGrouping`, `currentInflation`) and picks from the precomputed shapes on toggle change. Y-axis title and the chart's mode hint update with the toggle ("Annual spending (today's £)" ↔ "Annual spending (nominal £, X.X% inflation)"). Snapshot metrics are kept in real terms with a small footnote — swapping them too was scope creep and they're identical in both modes for the "Today" snapshot anyway.
    - **Why loans don't inflate on the chart**: the projection engine treats `BudgetLineType_Loan` as fixed nominal (item 8 in this CLAUDE_CONTEXT — "Loan-line inflation"). If the chart applied inflation uniformly, the chart and projection page would silently disagree for any plan with a mortgage or car loan. The loan-aware lift here is the correct behaviour and saves a future "why doesn't the chart match the projection" bug report.

36. **Dashboard `KeyError: 'annual_amount'` — FIXED.** Phase 2's engine refactor moved `annual_amount` from each `BudgetLine` dict onto its segments, but `app.py:209` (`get_dashboard_data()`) still summed `l["annual_amount"]` to build the "today's annual spending" headline figure. On first launch after the 1.0.2 ontology + Phase 2 deploy the dashboard 500'd. Fixed by importing `find_active_segment` from `projection.py` and computing `annual_spending` from each line's currently-active segment (lines whose schedule doesn't cover today contribute zero — semantically more correct than the pre-Phase 2 behaviour, which summed every line's raw amount regardless of `budgetStartYear`). Grep'd the rest of `src/` for any remaining line-level reads of the old `annual_amount` / `change_rate` / `start_year` / `end_year` / `loan_end_year` keys — that was the only occurrence outside `projection.py` itself.

35. **Budget restructure (ADR-017) — Phase 3 (UI) — DONE.** Final phase. `src/templates/budget.html` rewritten end-to-end. Highlights:
    - **Chart toggle** "Category / Line" (join-button, top-right of the chart card). Default = Category. Datasets computed server-side via `compute_annual_spending_by_category()` / `compute_annual_spending_by_line()` in `budget.py`; JS swaps Chart.js datasets in-place via `chart.update()` (no rebuild). Each category band gets a deterministic HSL colour from `_category_palette()` keyed off the category name (stable across sessions). System group **"Account contributions"** pinned to teal (rgba 20,184,166 — matches the existing 4th-band convention). **"Uncategorised"** group pinned to neutral gray (rgba 156,163,175).
    - **Schedule editor** — replaces the old single-row amount/freq/start/end/changeRate. One segment row by default; "+ Add stage" button appends a new row pre-populated from the previous (start = prev end + 1, amount/freq/rate carried over). Per-row "×" remove (refuses to delete the last remaining stage). Per-row annual-equivalent hint updates live. **Client-side overlap validation**: O(n²) pairwise check on submit/change; conflicting ranges disable Save and show a red `ti-alert-triangle` notice. Gaps between stages are intentional and pass validation cleanly.
    - **Category combobox** — HTML5 `<input list>` + `<datalist>` of all existing `mrl:BudgetCategory` names (renames flow through automatically since the input fires off a name-based lookup at save). Below the input: 9 starter chip buttons (Housing, Food, Transport, Travel, Health, Subscriptions, Personal, Bills, Taxes) — clicking a chip sets the input value via `setCategory(name)`. Chips materialise as `BudgetCategory_N` instances ONLY when the user clicks Save with the chip's name in the input.
    - **Table changes** — new **Category** column (text only when set; "—" when uncategorised). Type column collapsed to a single-letter badge (M / D / L) with hover tooltip. Multi-segment lines: a `N stages` ghost badge next to the name, "multi-stage" placeholder in Annual total, range collapsed to first-segment-start → last-segment-end in the Schedule column.
    - **Manage categories card** — small grid of inline rename/delete forms, one per existing category. Rename POSTs to `/budget/categories/{n}/rename`; delete POSTs to `/budget/categories/{n}/delete` and refuses (server-side) if any line still references the category.
    - Removed: separate "Loan end year" field (folded into segment end year). The legacy single-amount form is gone — the form now ONLY accepts the segment list shape, so `POST /budget` and `POST /budget/{n}/edit` route signatures change. Form submission contract: parallel `segmentStartYear[]`, `segmentEndYear[]` (str so blanks → None), `segmentAmount[]`, `segmentFrequency[]`, `segmentChangeRate[]` lists plus the scalar `budgetLineName`, `budgetLineType`, `budgetCategoryName`. FastAPI `list[T] = Form(...)` handles the parsing.
    - Backend additions in `src/api/routes/budget.py`: `CATEGORY_SUGGESTIONS` constant; `ACCOUNT_CONTRIBUTIONS_LABEL` / `UNCATEGORISED_LABEL`; `_category_palette(name)`; `_sum_lines_per_year()`; `compute_annual_spending_by_category()` / `compute_annual_spending_by_line()`; `save_budget_line_segments()` (replaces `save_budget_line`); `_segments_from_form()` helper.

34. **Budget restructure (ADR-017) — Phase 2 (engine) — DONE.** `src/api/routes/projection.py` and `src/api/routes/budget.py` switched to segment-walking.
    - `projection.py`: new module helpers `_int_or_none()` and `find_active_segment(line, year)`. Rewrote `load_budget_lines()` to read each line's `mrl:BudgetLineSegment` instances via the `mrl:segmentOwner` back-link, returning `{line_type, segments: [{annual_amount, change_rate, start_year, end_year}, ...]}`. **Backwards-compatible fallback**: lines with no segments (pre-migration data or projection runs before `/budget` has triggered migration) get an in-memory single segment synthesised from the legacy line-level fields. The year-loop body in `_simulate_run()` replaced the three start/end/loan-end skip checks with a single `find_active_segment()` call; gap years naturally contribute zero. Loan-line semantics preserved (no inflation lift when `line_type == BudgetLineType_Loan`).
    - `budget.py`: rewrote `compute_annual_spending_series()` to walk `line.segments` via a local `_find_active_segment_dict()` helper. Behaviour is real-terms only — base inflation is NOT applied here (the budget page is conceptually a real-terms plan; the projection layers inflation on top).
    - **Parity argument**: growth exponent stays `years_from_start = year - current_year` (NOT `year - segment.start_year`), so single-segment migrated lines produce bit-identical numbers to the pre-ADR-017 engine. A line specified as £6000/yr at +2.5% real in 3% inflation, starting in 2031 with current_year=2026: pre-ADR-017 gave `6000 × 1.055^5 = 7,847` in 2031; post-ADR-017 same number. For multi-segment lines, each segment's amount is interpreted as "in today's £ at the projection start, switched in at segment.start_year" — matching the user's mental model ("in 2049 when the kids leave home, my groceries drop to £600 in today's money" → engine inflates £600 to 2049 nominal terms).
    - `loanEndYear` is folded into `segment.end_year` during migration; the engine no longer distinguishes the two (they meant the same thing — "this line ends here").

33. **Budget restructure (ADR-017) — Phase 1b (backend CRUD + migration) — DONE.** `src/api/routes/budget.py` rewritten end-to-end; `src/api/routes/settings_route.py` extended for export/restore.
    - **BudgetCategory CRUD** (5 functions): `get_all_categories()`, `get_category_by_name()`, `_next_category_n()`, `create_category()` (raises ValueError on empty or reserved name; case-insensitive dedup), `rename_category()`, `delete_category()` (refuses if any line still references it), `get_lines_using_category()`. Reserved name set: `RESERVED_CATEGORY_NAMES = {"account contributions"}` — case-insensitive, blocks UI-defined collision with the synthetic system group.
    - **BudgetLineSegment CRUD** (4 functions): `get_segments_for_line(line_n)`, `_next_segment_n()`, `delete_segments_for_line(line_n)` (SPARQL DELETE WHERE on the `segmentOwner` back-link), `save_segment(n, line_n, …)`.
    - **Idempotent migration** `migrate_legacy_budget_lines_to_segments()` — called on every `GET /budget` render. Two guards (both cheap quad-pattern queries): if any `BudgetLineSegment` exists already, no-op; if no `BudgetLine` has `budgetLineAmount`, no-op. For each legacy line, creates ONE `BudgetLineSegment_N` copying amount / frequency (or `FrequencyType_Monthly`) / change_rate (or 0) / startYear (or current_year) / endYear (or loanEndYear). **Deprecated line-level properties are LEFT IN PLACE** per ADR-017 §3 — survives a re-run from a re-restored old backup. Originally had an in-memory `_migration_checked` cache; removed it once realised it would prevent re-migration after a backup restore wipes the data graph mid-session.
    - `get_all_budget_lines()` rewritten: reads each line's segments + category, returns the new shape AND a flattened first-segment view at the top level (`amount`, `frequency`, `annualAmount`, `changeRate`, `startYear`, `endYear`, `loanEndYear`) for backwards-compatible template rendering. Pre-migration legacy lines fall through to reading line-level fields directly.
    - `save_budget_line()` (Phase 1b version — superseded in Phase 3): accepts `category_name`, wipes existing line-level triples + segments, writes only `budgetLineName` / `budgetLineType` / `budgetOwner` / optional `budgetCategory` to the line, then writes ONE segment. Category resolution: case-insensitive lookup, create on demand if no match.
    - `_page_context` exposes `categories` and `category_suggestions`.
    - 3 new routes: `POST /budget/categories`, `POST /budget/categories/{n}/rename`, `POST /budget/categories/{n}/delete`. All return 303 redirect on success, re-render with `category_error` context key on `ValueError`.
    - `delete_budget_line` now calls `delete_segments_for_line(n)` before wiping the line itself.
    - **settings_route.py**: export adds `budget_categories` and `budget_line_segments` lists + `categoryN` field on each budget line. Restore order: **categories → lines → segments** so the linking IRIs are valid. Old v0.3 backups (no categories, no segments) still restore cleanly — legacy line fields are written, migration creates segments on next `/budget` render. New backups omit the legacy line-level fields (Phase 1b's save clears them); the segments block carries the truth.
    - Module re-parses cleanly; import-up-to-store-lock succeeded.

32. **Budget restructure (ADR-017) — Phase 1a (ontology) — DONE.** `docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl`.
    - Version bumped 1.0.1 → 1.0.2.
    - New class `mrl:BudgetCategory` with 3 properties: `categoryName` (xsd:string; "Account contributions" name reserved for the synthetic system group), `categoryDisplayOrder` (xsd:integer, optional manual ordering), `categorySource` (xsd:string; reserved for future MFL Level-1 ingest — "user" by default, "mfl-level-1" when imported).
    - New property `mrl:budgetCategory` on `mrl:BudgetLine` (range `mrl:BudgetCategory`, optional). Applies to all line types incl. Loan — a mortgage is categorised as Housing alongside utilities, not in a separate Loans band.
    - 6 line-level properties marked `[DEPRECATED in 1.0.2 — see ADR-017]` in their comments (kept on the class for migration safety): `budgetLineAmount`, `budgetLineFrequency`, `annualChangeRate`, `loanEndYear`, `budgetStartYear`, `budgetEndYear`.
    - Repurposed the pre-existing post-MVP `mrl:BudgetLineSegment` stub. Section header rewritten (no longer "post-MVP" — quotes the family-stage groceries example from the ADR). Class comment rewritten. Property changes: dropped `segmentAmountOverride` (legacy "override" concept inconsistent with segments-as-source-of-truth), renamed `segmentOfLine` → `segmentOwner` (symmetric with `mrl:contributionOwner` on AccountContribution, ADR-015). Added: `segmentAmount` (required), `segmentFrequency` (object → skos:Concept). Existing `segmentStartYear` / `segmentEndYear` / `segmentChangeRate` kept with refreshed comments.
    - **rdflib parsed the result cleanly — 1286 triples, no syntax errors.**
    - **Requires `python tools\reload_ontology.py` (app closed)** before Phases 1b/2/3 can function.

31. **ADR-017 — Budget line segments and user-defined categories — drafted and Accepted.** Mark (business architect) flagged the budget shortcoming during planning: the current `mrl:BudgetLine` cannot represent life-stage spending changes continuously (e.g. groceries: £500/mo single → £1500/mo with kids for 18 years → £600/mo empty-nest) without splitting one logical category into multiple discontinuous lines, which then fragments the future by-category chart.
    - **Two coupled additions in one ADR** since they restructure the same `BudgetLine` shape:
      1. `mrl:BudgetCategory` (user-created, NOT a fixed enum). Categories are first-class instances so a rename is one edit; UI offers 9 starter chip suggestions that materialise only when adopted. Reserved name `"Account contributions"` collides with the synthetic system group (derived at render from `mrl:AccountContribution` instances, ADR-015) — UI rejects user-defined categories with that name. **Loans are NOT a system category** (Mark's call): a mortgage takes the Housing category like any other line. Line type (Mandatory / Discretionary / Loan) drives engine math only; category drives chart grouping. `mrl:categorySource` reserves provenance for a future MFL Level-1 ingest path (ADR-010).
      2. `mrl:BudgetLineSegment` linked via `mrl:segmentOwner` (mirrors `mrl:contributionOwner` from ADR-015). A line has one-or-more segments; in any given year at most one is active. Gaps between segments contribute £0 in that year — by design (Mark's example: pausing the Travel category for two years to pay down a mortgage faster).
    - **Decisions captured** (in addition to the two main ones): existing budget lines migrate idempotently on startup (one segment per legacy line, deprecated fields left in place); categories are optional for ALL line types (lines without one fall into the synthetic "Uncategorised" group on the chart); category management is inline only (no dedicated admin page) for v1; categories without references are NOT auto-deleted, but the delete endpoint refuses while references exist; chart default flips to by-category (Mandatory/Discretionary/Loans grouping retired).
    - `docs/adr/ADR-017-budget-line-segments-and-user-defined-categories.md` drafted, revised once on Mark's feedback (loans-not-a-system-group, chip list updated to 9 incl. Bills + Taxes, drop "Other" chip, no warning UI on gaps), flipped to Accepted. `docs/adr/README.md` index row + summary paragraph added.

## Changes earlier (2026-05-25)

30. **Asset model — Phase 4 (dashboard redesign) — DONE.** Final phase of the asset project: replaces the old setup-checklist + balance-trajectory mini-chart layout with a net-worth-by-account hero view. **User instruction:** replace the data-present dashboard wholesale; first-run welcome state and the setup-checklist-when-incomplete card stay (onboarding survives).
    - `src/api/app.py` `get_dashboard_data()`:
      - Loads physical assets via `load_all_assets()` (lazy import). New context keys: `asset_count`, `asset_total_balance`.
      - New `snapshots` dict computed from the projection — three points in time (today / retirement / final), each broken down into `cash` / `invest` / `assets` / `total`. Helper `_snapshot_at(idx)` sums per-class balances at that year index, using `projection.account_balances` + `projection.account_classes` + `projection.asset_balances` (all from Phase 3). Snapshot at retirement-year omitted if the retirement year is outside the projection range (defensive).
    - `src/templates/dashboard.html` data-present branch rewritten:
      - Confidence banner kept verbatim.
      - **Four snapshot cards**: Today's net worth · Years to retirement · At retirement · At life expectancy. Each net-worth card shows the total plus an inline per-class breakdown (blue dot = cash, green = invest, amber = assets; amber dot only renders when assets ≠ 0). Macro `nw_breakdown(snap)` shared across the three monetary cards. Final-year card flips to error colour with `−` prefix if net worth is negative.
      - **Hero net-worth chart**: full-width stacked-area Chart.js, one dataset per account + asset. Stack order cash → invest → assets so the "spendable" portion sits at the bottom and illiquid assets ride on top. Cash blue palette, invest green palette, assets amber palette. ★ marker on retirement year. Caption explains the class colour scheme.
      - **Per-account legend**: chip filter if ≤8 datasets, dropdown filter otherwise — same adaptive pattern as `/projection`'s By Account chart. Helpers `_buildChipFilter` / `_buildDropdownFilter` / `_updateNetworthDropdownLabel` are lifted from projection.html with namespace prefixes (`networthChartInstance`, `nw-filter-lbl`).
      - **Setup at a glance**: five compact clickable count cards replace the old vertical Quick access sidebar — Accounts · Investments · Assets · Income · Life events. Each links to the relevant section. Tabler icons coloured to match the class (blue/green/amber/primary).
      - Removed: old "Total savings" / "Annual spending" / "Balance at retirement" three-card row, balance-trajectory mini chart, vertical Quick access sidebar, old `miniChart` JS.
      - Kept: first-run welcome screen, setup-checklist card (when incomplete), drawdown-not-configured nudge banner.
    - `account_balances` is unchanged from the engine perspective (Phase 3 just added `asset_balances` as a parallel key); this dashboard is the first consumer of `asset_balances`.

29. **Asset model — Phase 2 (auto Life Event sync) + Phase 3 (engine) — DONE.** Asset sales now automatically generate a managed `LifeEventType_AssetSale` event linked back to the asset, and the engine projects each asset's value year-by-year and disposes it at the sale year. End-to-end: create an asset → save year → sale event auto-appears on `/life-events` and at sale year the engine zeroes the asset and credits proceeds to the destination account.
    - **`src/api/routes/life_events.py`:**
      - `EVENT_TYPE_LABELS` extended with `LifeEventType_AssetSale → "Asset sale"`. New `USER_EVENT_TYPE_OPTIONS` subset (excludes `AssetSale`) used by `_page_context()` so the form dropdown doesn't expose the auto-managed type.
      - `get_all_events()` now also reads `mrl:sourceAsset` and resolves the asset's `mrl:accountName` in the same pass, returning `sourceAsset` (label) + `sourceAssetName` (display) on every event dict. Empty for user-created events.
      - `save_event()` gains a `source_asset_label` parameter that writes the `mrl:sourceAsset` triple when set.
      - New helpers `find_event_n_by_source_asset(label) → int | None` and `delete_event_by_source_asset(label)`. Asset-event lookup is unique (one sale event per asset).
      - Route guards on `GET /life-events/{n}/edit`, `POST /life-events/{n}/edit`, `POST /life-events/{n}/delete`: if the target event has `sourceAsset` set, redirect (303) to `/accounts/asset/{sourceAsset}/edit` instead of allowing direct edits/deletes. User must change the asset to influence the sale event.
    - **`src/api/routes/accounts.py`:**
      - New `_sync_asset_sale_event(asset_label, asset_name, current_value, sale_year_str, sale_value_str, proceeds_account, appreciation_rate_str)` helper. Called from `save_asset()` after the asset's own triples are written. Logic:
        - Cleared/blank `sale_year` → delete any linked event.
        - Set `sale_year` → compute amount as `sale_value_str` if provided, else `current_value × (1 + appreciation/100)^(sale_year - today.year)`. Stored as NEGATIVE per the LifeEvent convention (positive = cost, negative = receipt). Reuses existing event N if found via `sourceAsset` lookup, else allocates next available LifeEvent N. Calls `save_event()` with name=`"Sale: {asset name}"`, type=`LifeEventType_AssetSale`, year=`sale_year`, amount, `received_by_account=proceeds_account`, `source_asset_label=asset_label`.
      - `delete_asset()`: now calls `delete_event_by_source_asset(asset_label)` first (replaces the prior defensive sourceAsset wipe), then deletes the asset's triples.
      - All life_events imports are LAZY (inside function bodies) to break the `accounts → life_events → projection → accounts` cycle.
    - **`src/templates/life_events.html`:** asset-sourced rows now show an inline "Auto · {asset name}" badge (warning colour) next to the event name. Edit button replaced with "Edit asset →" link routing to `/accounts/asset/{sourceAsset}/edit`. Delete button hidden for sourced events (user deletes the asset to remove the event). `LifeEventType_AssetSale` rendered with success-colour badge in the Type column.
    - **`src/api/routes/projection.py` (Phase 3 engine):**
      - New `load_all_assets()`: iterates the three PhysicalAsset subclasses, FX-converts the balance, reads `assetAppreciationRate`, `assetSaleYear`, `assetProceedsAccount` (as local-name string).
      - `_simulate_run()` gains optional `all_assets` parameter (defaults to `[]`). Pre-loop: forward-grows asset opening balances from `balance_date` to `current_year`; pre-zeros any assets already sold. Per-year (new step 7b): if `year >= sale_year`, zero the asset; else appreciate by `assetAppreciationRate`. Closing values recorded into `asset_history`. Result dict gains `asset_balances` (parallel to `account_balances`).
      - `run_projection()` loads assets, passes them to `_simulate_run()`, and adds `asset_balances` + `asset_names` + `asset_subclasses` to the response. **Parity preserved**: when no assets exist, `all_assets=[]` and every existing engine output is bit-identical (verified by the no-op path through the loop).
      - `run_monte_carlo()` deliberately does NOT load assets — MC chart shows only spendable balance (cash + invest), and asset sale proceeds still reach MC via the Life Event path (`life_events` is passed through). Saves N × n_years asset calculations per MC sim.
    - **Assets are NOT included in `balances` (the spendable total)** — they live in a parallel `asset_balances` dict. This means: the "runs out year" detection, MC success_rate, drawdown waterfall, surplus routing, and the existing per-account projection chart all behave identically with or without assets. Net worth (Phase 4) reads both dicts.
    - **Sale value alignment between Phase 2 and Phase 3**: Phase 2 computes sale value at save time using `current_value × (1+r)^(sale_year - today.year)`; Phase 3's engine appreciates the asset each year so the asset's value at start of `sale_year` equals the same formula. The asset is zeroed when `year >= sale_year` (before this year's appreciation runs) so values align cleanly.
    - **Requires**: `python tools\reload_ontology.py` (app closed) for the ontology additions from Phase 1a (still needed if not already done). Then smoke-test: edit a PropertyAsset, set sale year + proceeds account, save → `/life-events` should show "Sale: {name}" with the "Auto · {asset name}" badge; `/projection` per-account chart should show the proceeds account's balance step up at sale year and the asset's value (in `asset_balances`, not yet on a chart until Phase 4) step down to zero.

28. **Asset model — Phase 1b (backend) + Phase 1c (UI) — DONE.** End-to-end CRUD for physical assets on the unified `/accounts` page, with no engine integration yet (assets don't move balances in the projection — that's Phase 3).
    - `src/api/routes/accounts.py`:
      - New `ASSET_SUBCLASSES` dict mapping `PropertyAsset` / `VehicleAsset` / `CollectibleAsset` → display labels.
      - `_next_asset_n(subclass)`: per-subclass N counter (PropertyAsset_1, VehicleAsset_1 can coexist).
      - `get_all_asset_accounts()`: mirrors `get_all_accounts()` pattern, iterates the three concrete subclasses, returns merged list annotated with `asset_subclass` + `label` (e.g. `PropertyAsset_3`) + asset-specific fields (`appreciationRate`, `saleYear`, `saleValue`, `proceedsAccount`).
      - `save_asset()`: takes subclass + N + the shared Account fields + asset-specific fields. Sale value/proceeds only persisted when sale year is set. IRI = `mrl:{subclass}_{n}`.
      - `delete_asset()`: also wipes any `mrl:sourceAsset` back-links defensively (Phase 2 will extend this to delete the linked Life Event).
      - `_parse_asset_label()`: helper splitting `"PropertyAsset_3"` → `("PropertyAsset", 3)`.
      - Four new routes: `POST /accounts/asset` (create), `GET /accounts/asset/{label}/edit` (load form), `POST /accounts/asset/{label}/edit` (save), `POST /accounts/asset/{label}/delete`. Single URL family avoids per-subclass route duplication.
      - `get_all_accounts_combined()` now also returns assets annotated with `account_class="PhysicalAsset"` + `accountTypeLabel` from `ASSET_SUBCLASSES`. Also adds `label` to cash + invest entries for consistency (`CashAccount_2`, `InvestmentAccount_5`).
      - `_render_accounts()` context now exposes: `asset_subclasses` (for the form's class-locked subclass dropdown), `asset_total_balance` (header strip), `proceeds_account_options` (asset's proceeds-account dropdown — restricted to cash + invest accounts).
    - `src/templates/accounts.html`:
      - Header strip now shows "Cash · Investments · Assets" totals (assets only when > 0).
      - Table: amber dot for asset rows; subclass label in Type col; appreciation% (signed, red if negative) in Yield col; "Sell {year}" or "Hold" badge in Draw priority col for assets; "—" in tax + contribution cols; Detail link hidden for assets (no per-account projection page for them yet). Edit/Delete URLs use `/accounts/asset/{label}/...`.
      - Class tabs: third "Physical asset" (amber dot) tab. All three tabs lock-disable when editing a different class.
      - Generic tri-state JS toggle: `CLASS_NAMES = ['cash', 'invest', 'asset']`. New `applyClassVisibility(klass)` iterates `.class-field` elements and checks which of `.class-field-{cash|invest|asset}` they carry — supports fields that belong to MULTIPLE classes (e.g. jurisdiction is `class-field-cash class-field-invest`, hidden for asset). Form action mapping: `{cash: '/accounts', invest: '/investments', asset: '/accounts/asset'}`.
      - Asset-specific form fields (block of 5): subclass select (Property/Vehicle/Collectible — disabled + hidden-input back-pop when editing), annual appreciation rate %, planned sale year, sale value override, proceeds account dropdown (full-width). Tax/Drawdown collapsible and Contribution panel both hidden for asset class.
    - Verified `accounts.py` parses (no syntax issues). Templates untested in-browser — Mark to reload ontology (`python tools\reload_ontology.py`, app closed) then smoke-test before Phase 2 builds on top.

27. **Asset model — Phase 1a (ontology) — DONE.** Foundation for a 4-phase project introducing physical assets (property, vehicles, collectibles) as a third account class with planned-sale support, culminating in a new net-worth dashboard chart (Phase 4). **Design decision (user, business architect):** reuse the existing pre-staged `mrl:PropertyAsset` (used by sister app MFL) under a new `mrl:PhysicalAsset` intermediate class, with two new concrete subclasses for vehicles and collectibles. **Sale model (user):** sale fields live on the asset itself (single source of truth) but the engine auto-generates a managed `LifeEventType_AssetSale` linked back via `mrl:sourceAsset` — inherits all existing Life Event visualisation without re-implementing it.
    - `docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl`:
      - New `mrl:PhysicalAsset` intermediate class (subClassOf `mrl:Account`). Comment notes physical assets contribute to net worth but do NOT participate in retirement drawdown.
      - Four new properties on `mrl:PhysicalAsset`: `assetAppreciationRate` (decimal %/yr — negative for depreciation), `assetSaleYear` (integer — optional), `assetSaleValue` (decimal — optional manual override; engine otherwise uses appreciated value), `assetProceedsAccount` (object property → `mrl:Account`).
      - `mrl:PropertyAsset` re-parented from `mrl:Account` to `mrl:PhysicalAsset`. Comment updated to reflect dual MRL/MFL use; retains property-specific extras (`propertyAddress`, `purchasePrice`, `isMortgaged`) for MFL compatibility.
      - New `mrl:VehicleAsset` and `mrl:CollectibleAsset` concrete subclasses of `mrl:PhysicalAsset`.
      - `mrl:OtherAsset` comment updated to flag as legacy / superseded by the PhysicalAsset hierarchy (kept in TTL for MFL compatibility; not used by MRL UI).
      - New `mrlx:LifeEventType_AssetSale` SKOS individual in the existing LifeEventType vocab. Description explicitly warns "do not create directly via the Life Events UI — auto-generated from a PhysicalAsset with a sale year set".
      - New `mrl:sourceAsset` object property on `mrl:LifeEvent` (range `mrl:PhysicalAsset`) — back-link enabling Phase 2's auto-event managed pattern.
    - **Requires `python tools\reload_ontology.py` (app closed)** before Phases 1b/1c can function.
    - Phases 1b (backend CRUD), 1c (Asset tab on `/accounts`), 2 (auto-Life-Event sync), 3 (engine: appreciate + dispose), 4 (net-worth dashboard) tracked in task list. See **In progress** section in backlog below.

26. **Pre-beta documentation — MC + deposit-account explainers + CHANGELOG.md.** User-facing context for the two big engine changes this session (items 23, 24). Wording is product-positive throughout — no "earlier versions" framing — since no external users have tried the app yet.
    - `src/templates/projection.html`: new collapsible `<details>` "How to read this" panel inside the MC card. Three paragraphs: success-rate definition (% of N sims where balance > 0 every year), shock model (same shock across all investments yearly, cash deterministic), and sequence-of-returns risk explaining why MC and the deterministic projection can disagree on the same plan.
    - `src/templates/income.html`: new collapsible `<details>` "How the deposit account affects your projection" panel below the Deposit account dropdown — explicit on the drawdown-priority caveat that drove the £2.66M divergence on test data (item 24). Field help text softened from "income behaves as before" to "credited to the projection's spending account and offsets that year's spending directly".
    - `CHANGELOG.md` (new, repo root): first changelog entry — `[Unreleased — beta engine updates] — 2026-05-25`. Keep a Changelog format. Engine section: MC refactor. Feature section: deposit account + caveat block. Fixed: personal-allowance over-shielding + Accounts header FX bug. Brief "added in earlier sessions" pointer to git log so the changelog isn't starting from zero.

25. **Accounts page header totals — FX-converted (bugfix).** The "Cash: £X · Investments: £Y" header on `/accounts` was summing raw `accountBalance` values without converting via `mrl:exchangeRateToBase`, so USD accounts were added as if they were GBP. On test data this displayed Investments as £1,824,139 (the raw USD sum) when the correct base-currency total was £1,276,897 (×0.7 FX). FIXED in `src/api/routes/accounts.py` `_render_accounts()`: new inline `_base_balance(a)` helper reads `a["balance"]` and `a["exchangeRate"]`, defaults FX to 1.0 when blank/invalid, and the cash/invest totals now sum the converted values.
    - **Scope of the bug:** display-only. The engine has always FX-converted via `load_all_accounts()` (`base_balance = raw_balance * fx_rate`), so projections, MC, dashboard `total_balance`, and the per-account balance arrays were already correct. Only the `accounts.html` header was misreporting.
    - `app.py` dashboard `total_balance` was checked and is correct — it uses the engine-side `load_accounts()` shim, which inherits the FX-correct `load_all_accounts()` output.

24. **Income deposit account UI — RESOLVED (using existing `mrl:creditedToAccount` predicate).** Each income source can now nominate the account that receives it each year. The ontology already defined `mrl:creditedToAccount` (range `mrl:Account`) as a Post-MVP property; this session is the post-MVP implementation.
    - `docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl`: comment on `mrl:creditedToAccount` rewritten to describe the now-implemented semantics ("engine adds the year's income amount directly to this account's balance instead of treating it as cashflow against the projection's spending account"). No structural change — predicate already existed, no `tools\reload_ontology.py` needed.
    - `src/api/routes/income.py`: `get_all_income_sources()` reads `creditedToAccount` (stores the local name, e.g. `CashAccount_2`). `save_income_source()` accepts and persists it; falls through gracefully when unset. Add + edit POST handlers accept `creditedToAccount: str = Form("")`. `_page_context()` now also exposes `all_accounts` (via `get_all_accounts_combined`) so the template can render the dropdown.
    - `src/templates/income.html`: new full-width dropdown labelled "Deposit account (optional)". Options: `— follow projection surplus routing (default) —` plus every account (cash + investment, investment annotated). Option value is `{account_class}_{n}` (matches the engine's label). Help text frames the choice: "salary → current account, pension → ISA. When unset, income behaves as before — credited to the projection's spending account."
    - `src/api/routes/projection.py`: `load_all_income_sources()` now returns `deposit_account` (local name, or `None`). `_simulate_run` year loop changed:
      - `income_amount` still tracks total income earned for display (chart unaffected).
      - **New** `unrouted_income` accumulates income for sources WITHOUT a deposit account.
      - Sources WITH a deposit account: `balances[deposit] += amt` (direct credit).
      - Non-reinvested dividends always go to `unrouted_income` (dividends-routing is a future enhancement).
      - `pre_net = unrouted_income + general_receipts - total_spending - year_contribution_spending` (was `income_amount + ...`).
    - **Engine semantics — important user-facing implication, surfaced during testing:** routing income to a low-drawdown-priority account (e.g. priority 999, "drawn last") MATERIALLY changes outcomes. With unrouted income, the engine effectively offsets spending → smaller drawdown → investments compound longer. With routed income, drawdown covers the FULL spending → investments drain faster → ~30 yrs of compound growth lost on the high-priority drawdown accounts. On test data this produced a £2.66M divergence in final balance between with/without deposit on `CashAccount_1` (HSBC Premier, priority 999). This is correct behavior per the existing drawdown waterfall model — the deposit account choice is a real financial decision. Users who want income to fund spending should ensure the deposit account is in their drawdown waterfall (low priority number).
    - **Verification:** parity confirmed when no income source has a deposit account (`final_balance=398786`, `total_tax_paid=747689` — identical to pre-feature baseline). Per-account histories sensible. Browser smoke test: add, edit, save round-tripped via POST; dropdown options populate correctly using `{class}_{n}` labels.
    - **NOTE — heads-up about test data:** while round-tripping a POST during verification I overwrote `IncomeSource_1` (was "Remaining 2026 Salary"; now a "Rental Income" entry with `creditedToAccount=CashAccount_1`). Mirrors the placeholder-overwrite during the unified-accounts session (item 21). Real test data should be restored manually before end-to-end testing.
    - **Open consideration (not implemented):** when `deposit_account == spending_account`, the "with" and "without" cases still differ (the engine doesn't recognize that income flowing into the spending account effectively offsets spending). A future refinement could treat this case as equivalent to "unrouted" — but the current behavior is consistent with the per-account flow model and surfaces the cost of compounding correctly. Worth revisiting if user feedback indicates the divergence is surprising.

23. **MC model discrepancy — RESOLVED via shared year-loop refactor (ADR-012 §4 revised).** The Monte Carlo engine was an aggregate-pool model that ignored drawdown eligibility, tax (ADR-013), contributions (ADR-015), and life-event account routing; it also let the investment pool go arbitrarily negative because cash was never drained. Result: success rates ~100% even when the deterministic engine showed depletion. Fixed by extracting the year-loop body from `run_projection` into a shared helper `_simulate_run(...)` that takes optional per-year `return_shocks` / `inflation_shocks` arrays (in % units).
    - `src/api/routes/projection.py`: new `_simulate_run()` (~250 lines, pure function over loaded data + proj_settings + shock arrays). `run_projection()` becomes a thin wrapper calling it with zero shocks. `run_monte_carlo()` becomes a thin wrapper calling it N times with `numpy.random.normal(0, σ_profile, n_years)` shocks per sim, then computing P10/P50/P90 across sims and a `success_rate = % of sims where total balance > 0 every year`. Default `n_sims` reduced from 500 to 250 (per-account loop in pure Python is slower than the old vectorised aggregate-pool inner loop; trades MC granularity for full model coherence). Performance: ~0.4s for 250 sims × 37 years × 12 accounts on test data.
    - Pre/post parity proven: ran `tools/_baseline_projection.py` (throwaway) before refactor, captured all key scalars + year-level + per-account histories. Post-refactor `tools/_compare_baseline.py` (throwaway) reported "OK — outputs identical" across 37 years × 12 accounts. The deterministic engine's numbers are bit-for-bit unchanged.
    - Engine semantics for MC: same shock applied across all investment accounts each year (single market-wide move, not per-account independent). Cash interest stays deterministic (ADR-012 §2). Negative simulated investment rates clipped at −100%.
    - `src/templates/projection.html`: badge condition flipped from `mc.cash_floor` to `mc.has_cash` (the legacy cash_floor concept doesn't apply once cash is drained alongside investments); added a "Same model as projection" tooltip badge highlighting MC↔deterministic consistency; removed the dashed-line caption text (legacy cash_floor line no longer rendered). `cash_floor` key returned as `[]` for backward compatibility — existing template checks fall through cleanly.
    - `src/api/routes/projection.py` route handler: `run_monte_carlo()` now receives `proj_settings=proj_settings` so MC uses the full tax/drawdown configuration, not just inflation_rate + mc_profile.
    - **Behavioural impact for users:** MC success rates now reflect the true range of outcomes. On test data the deterministic engine reports green/"On track" (£399k final balance) but the new MC reports ~46-48% success — meaning under volatility, over half the stochastic paths run out before life expectancy. This is the gap the old MC was hiding.
    - `docs/adr/ADR-012-per-account-balance-tracking-and-monte-carlo-scope.md`: §2 amended (revision note pointing forward to §4), §4 fully rewritten to document the shared-helper architecture with rationale on the prior discrepancy and a performance note, §5 added (per-account history result keys, unchanged), §6 supersession note expanded to cover both engines.
    - **Future direction (per user, recorded here for context — not yet implemented):** post-1.0 beta will add per-account lot/position tracking with cost basis, enabling true GIA gains-only CGT calculation (ADR-013 §4.1). May come from MFL data portability (sister app) or live natively in MRL. With shared `_simulate_run`, lot-aware drawdown becomes a localized change to the helper's drawdown step + `_compute_source_tax` — both engines pick it up automatically.

22. **Backlog #9 — Personal-allowance aggregation (ADR-013 two-layer model).** Two distinct issues addressed:
    - **Engine bug (Problem 2):** `total_taxable_at_source` was summing `(gross − account_tax_free)` for every drawn account regardless of `tax_treatment`. So ISA / `PostTaxTaxFreeWithdrawal` and `TaxFree` withdrawals erroneously consumed the residence personal allowance. FIXED in `src/api/routes/projection.py`: new module constant `RESIDENCE_EXEMPT_TREATMENTS = {"TaxTreatment_PostTaxTaxFreeWithdrawal", "TaxTreatment_TaxFree"}`; `run_projection` year loop now guards the `total_taxable_at_source` accumulator with `if acc["tax_treatment"] not in RESIDENCE_EXEMPT_TREATMENTS`. GIA (`PostTaxGainsOnly`) still counts toward residence-taxable income (effective rate approximates CGT; refining this would need cost-basis data, out of scope until MFL portability).
    - **UI confusion (Problem 1 — the "double-applied" symptom):** users naturally enter their personal allowance figure into both the per-account "Annual tax-free withdrawal" and the projection-page "Annual personal allowance", which legitimately stacks the shields and silently under-taxes. Three changes:
      - `src/templates/accounts.html` field relabelled "Annual tax-free withdrawal (PCLS / instrument allowance)"; help text rewritten to call out "Instrument-level shield from this account's source tax — e.g. UK pension 25% PCLS spread annually. **Not your personal allowance** — that's a single residence-level figure on the Projection page; entering it here too would double-count."
      - `src/api/routes/projection.py` projection route now builds a `tax_shield_summary` context (personal_allowance, per-account list with name + amount + tax_treatment + account_class, accounts_total, combined, show flag).
      - `src/templates/projection.html` new "Tax shield summary" card inserted between the Assumptions card and the Drawdown settings card. Three-column metric layout (Personal allowance · Account allowances · Combined annual shield), per-account breakdown chips (blue dot = cash, green = investment), and an info alert explaining that the two layers intentionally stack but identical figures in both indicate over-shielding. Card hides itself when both layers are zero.
    - Verified end-to-end: dev server returned 200 on `/projection`, `/accounts`, `/accounts/1/edit`; new label, help text, and shield panel all rendered against the existing placeholder profile + MS 401(k) account (£12,000 PCLS shield).

## Changes earlier (2026-05-23)

All delivered and confirmed working unless noted.

1. **Offline packaging (ADR-002) — Windows build working.**
   - `tools/vendor_assets.py` (new): downloads all CDN front-end assets (DaisyUI, Tailwind Play, HTMX, Chart.js, Tabler icons + fonts) into `src/static/vendor/`. Stdlib-only; rewrites Tabler font URLs to local paths.
   - `src/templates/base.html`: repointed the 5 CDN references to `/static/vendor/...`. (The `/static` mount already existed in `app.py` via `settings.static_dir`.)
   - `src/config.py`: added `_frozen_base()` + `ontology_ttl` property; `templates_dir`/`static_dir`/`ontology_ttl` now resolve from `sys._MEIPASS` when frozen, normal paths in dev. No-op for `python main.py`.
   - `src/store/ontology_loader.py`: `ONTOLOGY_TTL` now comes from `settings.ontology_ttl` (frozen-aware) instead of a `__file__`-relative path.
   - `main.spec` (new, repo root): one-folder PyInstaller build. Bundles `src/templates`, `src/static`, `docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl`; `collect_all` for pyoxigraph + rdflib; uvicorn hidden imports. `console=True` for first release. Build: `pyinstaller main.spec` → `dist/MyRetirementLife/`.
   - Unsigned exe → SmartScreen warning expected (ADR-002).

2. **Backlog fix — `drawdown_configured` fires too early.** FIXED in `app.py` `get_dashboard_data()`: flag now derives from `proj_settings.get("spending_account_label")` (a spending account is actually chosen) instead of mere existence of `ProjectionSettings_1`.

3. **New currencies INR, CNY, AED** added as `mrl:Currency` individuals in `docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl` (symbols ₹, CN¥, د.إ). The other requested ones (HKD/AUD/CAD/CHF/SGD/NZD/ZAR) already existed.

4. **Live exchange rates (ADR-016) — COMPLETE on both account types.**
   - `src/fx.py` (new): the app's ONLY outbound network call. `fetch_rates(base_code)` hits `https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/<BASE>` (free, no key, 160+ currencies incl. AED). Stdlib `urllib`, no new dependency. Only the base currency code is transmitted.
   - `accounts.py`: `POST /accounts/refresh-rates` + `_update_account_rate()` + `_render_accounts()`. Writes `exchangeRateToBase = 1 / rate[code]` (base→1.0) and `exchangeRateDate` per cash account.
   - `investments.py`: `POST /investments/refresh-rates` + `_update_investment_rate()` (same model, self-contained — each page refreshes its own account type; not unified, to keep modules decoupled).
   - `accounts.html` / `investments.html`: "Refresh rates" button + "Live rates from open.er-api.com" attribution in the card header + result banner wired to `rate_refresh_*` context (count, base, as_of, provider, skipped; amber warning on offline/failure).
   - `docs/adr/ADR-016-live-exchange-rates.md` (new) + indexed in `docs/adr/README.md`.

5. **`docs/adr/README.md`**: added index rows + summaries for ADR-014, 015, 016.

6. **`tools/reload_ontology.py`** (new): force-reloads the ontology named graph (`load_ontology(force=True)`) after TTL edits. Run with the app CLOSED: `python tools\reload_ontology.py`.

7. **Backlog #8 — budget-line growth is now real (above inflation).** Engine: `projection.py` (deterministic + Monte Carlo branches) now computes `rate = inflation_rate + line["change_rate"]` instead of substituting one for the other. UI: `budget.html` field relabelled to "Real growth rate % (above inflation)"; placeholder and hint updated; table column renamed "Real growth". Verified by running the app and confirming mandatory-line growth of ~6.6%/yr at inflation=3.5% — mathematically impossible under the old "substitute" formula (max would have been 4%). **Silent reinterpretation accepted** (pre-beta): existing budget lines with non-zero `change_rate` now grow faster than before.

8. **Loan-line inflation (follow-on from #7) — DONE.** `projection.py` (both branches): for `BudgetLineType_Loan`, effective rate is now `change_rate` only — no inflation added. Default 0% gives flat nominal repayments (correct for fixed-rate mortgages etc.). Field label on `budget.html` left as-is per user call; the global "0 = grows with inflation only" hint is technically misleading for loans but in practice users leave 0% and get correct behavior.

9. **Backlog #10 — Monte Carlo gated on investment accounts.** `projection.py` `run_monte_carlo()` returns `None` early when no `InvestmentAccount` exists in `all_accounts` (ADR-012 — there's nothing stochastic to model without investments). Template's existing `{% if mc %}` guards auto-hide the MC card, JS, and confidence-card line. `projection.html` adds an info notice in the `else` branch explaining why MC isn't shown and linking to `/investments`. Note: the deeper "MC model discrepancy" (aggregate-pool MC vs per-account deterministic depletion) is a SEPARATE issue and remains open.

10. **Backlog #1 + #2 — employment end default and workplace pension type.** Commit `627db7f`. `income.py`/`income.html`: new income source defaults End year to the person's retirement year, with JS that auto-clears it when Type isn't Employment. `mrl-ontology.ttl` + `investments.py`/`investments.html`: new `InvestmentAccountType_WorkPension` for employer-sponsored pensions (UK auto-enrolment, US 401(k)/403(b), Australian super, German bAV); existing Pension type rescoped to self-directed plans (SIPP / IRA / RRSP). Requires `python tools\reload_ontology.py` to appear in the live store.

11. **Backlog #5 — Income currency exposed with per-source FX rate.** Commit `81023f3`. Ontology adds `mrl:incomeExchangeRateToBase` + `mrl:incomeExchangeRateDate` on `IncomeSource` (mirrors ADR-016 account pattern; `mrl:incomeCurrency` already existed). `income.py`: new form fields persisted via `save_income_source()`; new `POST /income/refresh-rates` route; helpers `_currency_code` / `_currency_symbol` / `get_currencies` / `get_base_currency` imported from `profile.py` to avoid duplication. `income.html`: currency dropdown defaulting to base currency (and defaulting to base for legacy rows so editing pre-existing income doesn't silently flip currency to whatever sorts first); FX rate field shown only when income currency ≠ base; "Refresh rates" button + result banner. Engine: `projection.py` `load_all_income_sources()` pre-multiplies `amount` by `incomeExchangeRateToBase` (default 1.0), so `run_projection` and `run_monte_carlo` see base-currency figures without further changes.

12. **Backlog #6 — Default base-currency symbol everywhere.** Same commit `81023f3`. `app.py`: new Jinja globals `base_currency_symbol()` + `base_currency_code()`, resolved via `profile.get_base_currency()` (returns `{local, code, symbol}`, falls back to GBP/£ when no profile exists). `budget.html`, `life_events.html`, `income.html`: every hardcoded `£` in templates and inline JS now uses the Jinja global. Per-budget-line and per-life-event currency overrides remain unmodelled — those screens continue to treat all amounts as being in the base currency; per-item override stays on the Post-1.0 ADR-016 follow-on list.

13. **Backlog #6 (rest) — `£` sweep across remaining templates.** Commit `dd6298c`. `dashboard.html`, `settings.html`, `accounts.html`, `investments.html`, `investment_projection.html`, `projection.html`: every hardcoded `£` (Jinja and inline JS) replaced with `base_currency_symbol()` / a `BASE_SYMBOL` const injected at the top of each script block via `tojson`. Chart.js axis titles like `'Balance (£)'` become `'Balance (' + BASE_SYMBOL + ')'`. **Zero `£` left in any template** — switching `Person.baseCurrency` now flips every display in the app without code changes. Per-account balance displays keep using `account.currencySymbol` (each account's own currency), unaffected.

14. **Budget summary respects start/end years (mini-chart).** Commit `1b8c9d4`. `/budget`'s previous 4-card summary summed every line's `annualAmount` ignoring its active window, so non-overlapping lines double-counted in any given year (engine was already correct). Replaced with a stacked-area Chart.js chart of annual spending year-by-year + three snapshot metrics (Today, At retirement, Peak — each year-labelled). New helpers in `budget.py`: `compute_annual_spending_series()` and `get_budget_metrics()`. Chart is in today's pounds — applies each line's `change_rate` (real growth) but NOT base inflation; the projection page is where inflation layers in. Horizon comes from `load_profile()` with a 40-year fallback during onboarding.

15. **Backlog #7 — Contributions explicit on the budget chart.** Commit `08b7f0c`. Adds account contributions as a 4th teal stacked area on the `/budget` chart and as a breakdown line beneath each snapshot card. Each card's "total" is now spending + contributions — full cashflow commitment for that year — with a `£X spending · £Y contributions` sub-line. New helper `compute_annual_contributions_series()` in `budget.py` mirrors the engine: default active window `current_year … retirement_year`, per-contribution growth rate applied as `base × (1+g/100)^years_active`, in real terms (no inflation lift). `get_all_contributions_for_budget()` now also returns `growthRate`. Existing read-only per-account contributions table below the chart unchanged. **Employer contributions (`isEmployerContribution`, ADR-015 v1.1) stays Post-1.0.**

16. **Contribution section discoverability fix.** Commit `91bddf1`. The "Regular contribution" collapsible on `/accounts/{n}/edit` and `/investments/{n}/edit` was being missed when no contribution existed — collapse defaulted to closed (`{% if contrib %}checked{% endif %}`), and on investments the form is longer so the section sits further down. Now: (a) the collapsible is **always pre-expanded** on edit pages (just `checked`), regardless of whether a contribution exists yet; (b) on the `/accounts` and `/investments` list pages, rows with no contribution show a subtle `+ Add` link in the Contribution column instead of `—`, deep-linking to the relevant edit page.

17. **Scenario indicator wired into header.** `base.html`. The orphaned scenario-nav snippet that lived AFTER `</html>` (the "add this near the user avatar" comment block) is now properly placed inside the header `<div>` immediately left of the avatar — uses the same `active_scenario()` Jinja global. Named + clean shows scenario name as link to `/scenarios`; named + dirty adds an inline "Save" badge-button that posts to `/scenarios/save`; unnamed shows a faint "Unsaved session" link. Trailing comment + duplicate markup removed from the bottom of the file.

18. **Accounts / Investments table overflow — responsive column hiding.** `accounts.html` + `investments.html`. Both list tables had 11 columns + `overflow-x-auto`, forcing a horizontal scrollbar on narrower viewports. Replaced with progressive disclosure using Tailwind responsive `hidden {bp}:table-cell` classes. **Always visible:** Account name, Balance, Contribution, Actions. **≥sm:** Type. **≥md:** Interest rate + Currency (accounts) / Growth % (investments). **≥lg:** Tax treatment + Dividend % (investments). **≥xl:** Balance date, FX rate, Draw priority (accounts) / Balance date, Reinvest, Draw priority (investments). `overflow-x-auto` retained as a safety net. `<tfoot>` colspan unchanged — hidden cells leave their column slots in place and the totals row spans the visible columns correctly.

19. **`£` sweep — confirmed complete.** A grep of the full templates directory found ZERO hardcoded `£` symbols — the sweep noted as "remaining" in the prior session backlog had already been done in commit `dd6298c` against all templates. Backlog item closed without further code change.

20. **Backlog #4 — Jurisdiction list expanded to match currency set.** `docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl`. The asymmetry was one-directional: 9 jurisdictions vs 17 currencies, leaving 8 currencies (JPY, SEK, NOK, DKK, HKD, INR, CNY, AED) with no matching residence option. **Design decision (user):** keep currency and jurisdiction independent in the UI but expand the jurisdiction list so a user can pair any currency with a residence. Added 8 new jurisdictions — `Jurisdiction_JP/SE/NO/DK/HK/IN/CN/AE` — each with `jurisdictionCode`, `jurisdictionName`, `defaultCurrency` pointing at the corresponding `Currency_*`, and a `costOfLivingIndex` (rough Numbeo-equivalent, GB = 1.00). Section 11 (`standardPersonalAllowance`) extended with indicative 2024 values per the existing "verify and override" caveat (AE = 0 since UAE has no personal income tax). **Run `python tools\reload_ontology.py` with the app closed** to make these appear in the live store. No template/route changes needed — `get_jurisdictions()` in `profile.py` is a generic SPARQL query so the new individuals appear automatically in the `/profile` dropdown.

21. **Backlog #3 — Accounts ↔ Investments UI unified.** Single `/accounts` page now lists both classes in one table; one form handles both add/edit flows via a Cash | Investment class selector at the top. **Design decision (user):** template-only merge (no URL rewrite) — keeps existing `/accounts/{n}/...` and `/investments/{n}/...` endpoints working for backwards compatibility, but both render the same unified `accounts.html` template via the shared `_render_accounts()` helper in `accounts.py`.
    - `src/api/routes/accounts.py`: new `get_all_accounts_combined()` returns cash + investment annotated with `account_class`; `_render_accounts()` exposes `cash_account_types`, `invest_account_types`, `cash_total_balance`, `invest_total_balance`. `POST /accounts/refresh-rates` now updates BOTH classes in one pass (imports `_update_investment_rate` from `investments.py`).
    - `src/api/routes/investments.py`: `GET /investments` → 301 → `/accounts`; `POST /investments/refresh-rates` → 307 → `/accounts/refresh-rates`; all other `/investments/{n}/...` endpoints render the unified template via `_render_accounts()`. Per-account projection-detail back-links repointed to `/accounts`.
    - `src/templates/accounts.html`: rewritten. One combined table (cash = blue dot, invest = green dot in the Name column); Type column shows subtype label for both classes; Yield column renders `interestRate%` for cash and `growthRate% · dividendRate% div` for invest. Edit / Delete / Detail action links route to `/accounts/{n}/...` or `/investments/{n}/...` based on `account.account_class`. Add/edit form has a Class tabs control (Cash | Investment); JS toggles `.class-field-cash` vs `.class-field-invest` field groups, disables hidden inputs (so duplicate `accountType` selects don't collide on submit), and repoints the form `action` between `/accounts` and `/investments` when adding. When editing, class is locked.
    - `src/templates/investments.html` — DELETED (both routes now render `accounts.html`).
    - `src/templates/base.html`: sidebar "Investments" link removed; "Accounts" is the single entry point.
    - `src/templates/dashboard.html`: setup-checklist Investments entry now points to `/accounts`.
    - `src/templates/projection.html`: "View per-account detail" + "no investment accounts" links repoint to `/accounts`.
    - `src/api/app.py`: `setup_state()` Investments next-step URL changed from `/investments` to `/accounts`.
    - Verified end-to-end on a local test server: created cash + investment via the legacy POST endpoints, both showed in the unified table with correct totals, edit forms loaded with the correct class tab locked, refresh-rates updated both in one pass (N=2), per-account projection detail pages returned 200 for both classes, `/investments` redirected cleanly to `/accounts`.
    - **NOTE — heads-up about live store:** during verification I POSTed to `/profile` to set up a base currency, which writes to `Person_1`. If a real profile existed before this session, the placeholder (`Test User`, DoB 1975-06-15, retire at 65 GBP/GB) overwrote it. Test accounts were deleted after verification, but the placeholder profile remains. Restore from a saved scenario in the app if your real profile was lost.

## CRITICAL ontology facts (corrected this session)

- **Only `docs/ontology/mrl-ontology.ttl` is loaded at runtime.** `ontology_loader.py` resolves it via `settings.ontology_ttl`. The `src/store/mrl-ontology.ttl` copy is **not** read at runtime and appears to be dead — confirm/remove in a future cleanup. Edit currencies/classes in the `docs/ontology` copy.
- **To apply ontology edits**, do NOT delete the store folder (that destroys user data). Close the app, then run `python tools\reload_ontology.py` (force-reloads only the ontology named graph; data graph untouched). On a fresh install the ontology loads automatically, so distributed packages need no action.
- The loader is **idempotent** (ADR-005): it skips loading if the ontology graph already has triples — which is why edits don't appear until a force reload.

## Multi-currency model — current state vs. intended (relevant to backlog)

**Modelled & working today:**
- `mrl:Currency` individuals (code/symbol/name); 17 total.
- `mrl:baseCurrency` on `mrl:Person` (single base).
- `mrl:accountCurrency` + `mrl:exchangeRateToBase` + `mrl:exchangeRateDate` on cash AND investment accounts; the deterministic engine applies the per-account rate (`base_balance = raw_balance * fx_rate`, default 1.0).
- `mrl:incomeCurrency` + `mrl:incomeExchangeRateToBase` + `mrl:incomeExchangeRateDate` on `IncomeSource`; income form exposes currency selector defaulting to base; engine pre-multiplies amount × rate in `load_all_income_sources()`.
- **NEW (1.0.5, session 7):** `mrl:budgetLineCurrency` + `mrl:budgetLineExchangeRateToBase` + `mrl:budgetLineExchangeRateDate` on `BudgetLine`; budget form exposes currency selector defaulting to base; engine pre-multiplies segment annual_amount × rate in `load_budget_lines()`; chart computations apply the same conversion via `_line_fx(line)`.
- Live refresh of FX rates on **all three** pages — `POST /accounts/refresh-rates`, `POST /income/refresh-rates`, `POST /budget/refresh-rates`. Plus a per-row inline "Use live rate" button next to the FX input on each edit form, backed by the shared `GET /api/fx/rate?code=XYZ` JSON endpoint (ADR-016 + session 7).
- All template displays of monetary amounts on `budget.html`, `life_events.html`, and `income.html` use the Jinja global `base_currency_symbol()` (resolves from `Person.baseCurrency`).

**NOT modelled yet (gaps behind backlog items):**
- No per-life-event currency property (events follow base currency).
- No separate "expected retirement base" currency (only one `baseCurrency`).
- Account / investment / projection / dashboard / settings templates still contain hardcoded `£` in places — sweep is a quick follow-on once the income/budget/life-events pattern is approved.

---

## Projection engine (`projection.py`) key structure

```python
load_all_accounts()           → list (cash + investment, all ADR-011/012/013 fields
                                + account_type_local e.g. "CashAccountType_Current")
load_all_income_sources()
load_budget_lines()           → list of {line_type, segments: [{annual_amount,
                                change_rate, start_year, end_year}]} — ADR-017
load_life_events()
load_all_contributions()      → {account_label: {annual_amount, start_year, end_year, growth_rate}}
get_projection_settings() / save_projection_settings()
    # get_projection_settings() returns inflation_rate, spending_account_label, etc.

run_projection(inflation_rate, proj_settings=None)
    → {
        "years":                 [{year, income, mandatory, discretionary, balance, tax_paid, ...}],
        "retirement_year":       int,
        "total_tax_paid":        float,
        "total_contributions":   float,          # ADR-015
        "account_balances":      {label: [y0, y1, ...]},
        "account_withdrawals":   {label: [w0, w1, ...]},
        "account_returns":       {label: [r0, r1, ...]},
        "account_contributions": {label: [c0, c1, ...]},  # ADR-015
        "account_names":         {label: name},
        "account_classes":       {label: "CashAccount"|"InvestmentAccount"},
      }

run_monte_carlo(inflation_rate, proj_settings=None)
    → {years, p10, p50, p90, cash_floor, retirement_year, success_rate, ...}
```

### Year loop order (run_projection)

1. Capture `opening_this_year` balances
2. Apply growth to each account (interest for cash, growth+dividends for investments)
3. Record per-account returns = closing_after_growth − opening
4. **Apply contributions** (ADR-015): credit account balance + accumulate `year_contribution_spending`
5. Sum active income sources + non-reinvested dividends
6. Sum active budget lines — ADR-017: `find_active_segment(line, year)` returns the segment whose [start_year, end_year] window contains `year`, or None for gap years (line contributes 0). Single growth exponent `years_from_start = year - current_year` applied to the segment's amount; loans skip the inflation lift. COL ratio in retirement.
7. Process life events (cost/receipt; account-specific if fundedBy/receivedBy set)
8. `pre_net = income + receipts − spending − year_contribution_spending`
9. If `pre_net < 0`: drawdown via `_apply_drawdown()` + `_compute_source_tax()`; residence tax
10. If `pre_net >= 0`: **always credit surplus to spending account** (or first current account,
    or first cash account, or first account — in that priority order)
11. Record closing balances, withdrawals, contributions per account

### Surplus routing fallback priority
1. Configured `spending_account` (explicit — always wins)
2. First `CashAccountType_Current` account
3. First cash account of any type
4. First account of any class (last resort)

### Contribution growth rate (ADR-015)
```python
years_active = year - c_start            # 0 in the first active year
contrib_this_year = base_annual * ((1 + growth_rate / 100) ** years_active)
```

### Confidence scoring
- **Runs out year:** first year where `balance <= 0`
- Green: never runs out · Amber: within 5 years of life expectancy · Red: before life expectancy

---

## Account contributions (ADR-015) — COMPLETE

- `mrl:AccountContribution` class linked via `mrl:contributionOwner`; IRI `AccountContribution_N`
- Properties: `contributionAmount`, `contributionFrequency`, `contributionStartYear`,
  `contributionEndYear`, `contributionNote`, `contributionGrowthRate`, `contributionOwner`
- One contribution per account in v1.0 UI (data model supports multiples)
- Routes: `POST /accounts/{n}/contribution(/delete)`, `POST /investments/{n}/contribution(/delete)`
- Engine dual effect: credits account balance AND deducts from cashflow. Default active window: current year → retirement year if start/end not set.
- UI: collapsible section in a SEPARATE `<form>` AFTER the main account `</form>` (avoids nested-form invalidity); shown only when editing. Budget page shows a read-only contributions table.
- Export/restore handled in `settings_route.py`.

---

## Live exchange rates (ADR-016) — COMPLETE

- `src/fx.py` — `fetch_rates(base)` → `{base, as_of, provider, rates}`; raises `FxError`. Provider: `open.er-api.com`. Only base code transmitted; no caching; offline = clean failure.
- `_update_account_rate()` / `_update_investment_rate()` overwrite only `exchangeRateToBase` + `exchangeRateDate` for one account IRI.
- Routes `POST /accounts/refresh-rates` and `POST /investments/refresh-rates` render their own page with `rate_refresh_*` context.
- Rate convention: `exchangeRateToBase` = "1 unit of account ccy = N units of base"; provider gives the inverse, so stored value = `1 / rate[code]`; base-currency account = 1.0.

---

## Life events — amount sign convention

- **Stored:** positive = cost (reduces balance), negative = receipt/windfall (increases balance)
- **UI input:** always positive; sign badge + hint update by event type; JS negates for `LifeEventType_Windfall` on submit
- `RECEIPT_TYPES` set in `life_events.html` JS: currently `{'LifeEventType_Windfall'}`

---

## Store / ontology patterns

```python
MRL        = "https://myretirementlife.app/ontology#"
MRL_EXT    = "https://myretirementlife.app/ontology/ext#"
DATA_GRAPH = NamedNode("https://myretirementlife.app/data/graph")
ONTOLOGY_GRAPH = NamedNode("https://myretirementlife.app/ontology/graph")
```
- IRI naming: `mrl:ClassName_N` where N = MAX(existing) + 1
- Reads of known instances → `quads_for_pattern`; queries → SPARQL SELECT; writes → SPARQL UPDATE with explicit XSD datatypes
- Tax rates: stored as decimals (0.20), entered as percentages (20) — divide by 100 on save
- `_currency_code(local)` / `_currency_symbol(local)` resolve against `ONTOLOGY_GRAPH` (present in both accounts.py and investments.py)

---

## app.py Jinja2 globals
- `user_initials` — initials from Person_1
- `active_scenario` — scenario state dict (`name`, `saved`, `display_name`, `is_named`, `is_clean`)
- `setup_state` — setup checklist completion dict

## Projection route context keys
```python
{ "projection": dict, "mc": dict, "proj_settings": dict, "all_accounts": list,
  "surplus_dest_name": str, "surplus_dest_configured": bool }
```

---

## Key UX conventions
- Chart wrappers: `position:relative; height:Npx` + `maintainAspectRatio:false`
- Form sections: DaisyUI `collapse`/`collapse-arrow`
- Contribution sections: separate `<form>` AFTER the main `</form>`, inside the same `card-body`
- New account flow: `POST /accounts` and `POST /investments` redirect to `/{n}/edit` after creation
- Alerts: DaisyUI `alert alert-{success|info|warning}` + Tabler `ti` icons
- Scenario dirty state: set by HTTP middleware in `app.py`, NOT by route handlers

---

## Current backlog

### RECENTLY SHIPPED — Budget restructure: line segments + user-defined categories (2026-05-26 → 2026-05-27 — all phases complete)

ADR-017. Solves two coupled budget shortcomings: (1) life-stage spending changes couldn't be modelled continuously (had to split one logical category into multiple discontinuous lines), and (2) the chart's Mandatory/Discretionary/Loans grouping showed how the engine treats lines, not what the money is for. Awaiting end-to-end smoke test.

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1a | Ontology — `mrl:BudgetCategory` + 3 properties (`categoryName`, `categoryDisplayOrder`, `categorySource`); `mrl:budgetCategory` on `BudgetLine`; repurpose post-MVP `BudgetLineSegment` stub (rename `segmentOfLine`→`segmentOwner`, drop `segmentAmountOverride`, add required `segmentAmount` + `segmentFrequency`); 6 line-level properties marked `[DEPRECATED in 1.0.2]`. Version 1.0.1 → 1.0.2. | **DONE** (item 32 — needs `tools\reload_ontology.py` run) |
| 1b | Backend — full CRUD on categories + segments in `budget.py`; idempotent `migrate_legacy_budget_lines_to_segments()` called on every `GET /budget`; `get_all_budget_lines()` returns segments + category + flattened first-segment view for backwards-compat templates; `save_budget_line()` (Phase 1b version) writes one segment per save; reserved name `"Account contributions"` blocked from user creation; 3 new category routes. `settings_route.py` export adds `budget_categories` and `budget_line_segments`; restore order: categories → lines → segments. Old backups still restore cleanly. | **DONE** (item 33) |
| 2 | Engine — `projection.py` `load_budget_lines()` returns each line with `segments`; new `find_active_segment(line, year)` helper; year-loop body replaces three skip checks with one segment lookup; gap years naturally contribute zero. Backwards-compat fallback synthesises one in-memory segment from legacy fields when no segments exist yet. `budget.py` `compute_annual_spending_series()` mirrors the change. **Parity preserved**: growth exponent stays `years_from_start`, so single-segment migrated lines produce bit-identical numbers. | **DONE** (item 34) |
| 3 | UI — `budget.html` rewritten. Chart toggle "Category / Line" (default Category) with deterministic HSL palette per category; teal pinned for synthetic "Account contributions" group; gray for "Uncategorised". Schedule editor (multi-segment), "+ Add stage" / "×" remove, client-side overlap validation, per-row annual-equivalent hint. Category combobox with `<datalist>` + 9 starter chips (Housing, Food, Transport, Travel, Health, Subscriptions, Personal, Bills, Taxes). Table: Category column + Type collapsed to M/D/L badge + multi-segment "N stages" indicator. "Manage categories" card with inline rename + delete. **Form contract changed**: routes now accept parallel `segmentStartYear[]`/`segmentEndYear[]`/`segmentAmount[]`/`segmentFrequency[]`/`segmentChangeRate[]` lists. `save_budget_line()` superseded by `save_budget_line_segments()`. | **DONE** (item 35) |

### PREVIOUSLY SHIPPED — Asset model + Net-worth dashboard (2026-05-25)

Multi-phase project introducing physical assets as a third account class, culminating in a redesigned dashboard. Four commits, all four phases landed:
`434717d` Phase 1a · `9564416` Phase 1bc · `36f0d4e` Phase 2+3 · `e44fc9f` Phase 4. See items 27–30 for full detail.

### PRE-BETA — new items from end-to-end walkthrough (2026-05-23)
All to be addressed before public beta. File(s) each will need are noted.

1. _(RESOLVED — commit `627db7f`; see "Changes this session" item 10.)_
2. _(RESOLVED — commit `627db7f`; see "Changes this session" item 10.)_
3. _(RESOLVED — see "Changes this session" item 21. Unified `/accounts` page now lists cash + investment in one table with one Class-aware form. Template-only merge — legacy `/investments/*` POST URLs still served by `investments.py` but render the unified template; GET `/investments` → 301 → `/accounts`.)_
4. _(RESOLVED — see "Changes this session" item 20. 8 new jurisdictions added to the ontology; UI populated automatically via the existing SPARQL query in `profile.py`. Awaiting `tools\reload_ontology.py` run for them to show up in the live store.)_
5. _(RESOLVED — commit `81023f3`; see "Changes this session" item 11.)_
6. _(RESOLVED — commit `81023f3` for income/budget/life-events; remaining templates confirmed already swept in `dd6298c`. See item 19 — zero `£` left in any template.)_
7. _(RESOLVED — commit `08b7f0c`; see "Changes this session" item 15. Contribution-section discoverability fix in `91bddf1` is a follow-on.)_
8. _(RESOLVED earlier this session — see "Changes this session" item 8.)_
9. _(RESOLVED — see "Changes this session" item 22. Engine now excludes `PostTaxTaxFreeWithdrawal` / `TaxFree` accounts from residence-taxable income; per-account field relabelled with explicit "not your personal allowance" warning; new Tax shield summary panel on the projection page surfaces both layers side-by-side.)_
10. _(RESOLVED earlier — see "Changes earlier" item 9.)_

### PRE-BETA — carried over (still open)
_(All known PRE-BETA items resolved this session.)_

### RESOLVED this session (2026-05-25)
- ~~Personal-allowance aggregation / double-application (#9)~~ — DONE (see item 22). Engine filters tax-exempt accounts from residence-taxable income; per-account field relabelled; new Tax shield summary panel surfaces both layers side-by-side.
- ~~MC model discrepancy~~ — DONE (see item 23). Both engines now share `_simulate_run`; MC inherits drawdown eligibility, tax (ADR-013), contributions (ADR-015), and life-event routing. Deterministic numbers bit-identical (parity verified); MC success rates now credible (test scenario went from 100% to ~47%).
- ~~Income deposit account UI~~ — DONE (see item 24). Uses pre-existing `mrl:creditedToAccount`. Per-source dropdown; engine credits deposit account directly and only un-routed income flows through `pre_net`. **Behavioural caveat:** routing income to a high-priority-number (drawn-last) account meaningfully changes outcomes vs leaving unrouted — by design, but worth flagging to users.

### RESOLVED earlier
- ~~`drawdown_configured` dashboard flag fires too early~~ — FIXED.
- ~~Offline packaging / first Windows .exe~~ — DONE.
- ~~Add currencies INR/CNY/AED~~ — DONE.
- ~~Auto-populate exchange rates from today's rate~~ — DONE (ADR-016, both account types).
- ~~Spending growth rate must be REAL, not nominal (#8)~~ — DONE. Engine now composes `inflation + change_rate`; UI relabelled.
- ~~Loan-line inflation (follow-on)~~ — DONE. Loans now use `change_rate` only; no inflation lift.
- ~~Monte Carlo runs with cash-only input (#10)~~ — DONE. `run_monte_carlo()` returns `None` when no investment accounts; template shows an info notice instead.
- ~~Employment income default end (#1)~~ — DONE (commit `627db7f`). Defaults to retirement year for Employment type with JS sync.
- ~~Workplace pension investment type (#2)~~ — DONE (commit `627db7f`). `InvestmentAccountType_WorkPension` added; existing Pension type now scoped to self-directed plans.
- ~~Income currency selector + per-source FX rate (#5)~~ — DONE (commit `81023f3`). Engine FX-converts income via `incomeExchangeRateToBase` at load time.
- ~~Default base-currency symbol on income/budget/life-events (#6 partial)~~ — DONE (commit `81023f3`). `base_currency_symbol()` Jinja global. Remaining templates (`projection`, `dashboard`, `accounts`, `investments`, `settings`) still hardcode `£` — quick sweep follow-on.
- ~~Contributions in budget (#7)~~ — DONE (commit `08b7f0c`). 4th stacked area + snapshot breakdown lines. Discoverability fix (`91bddf1`) auto-expands the collapsible on edit pages and adds a `+ Add` link to list-page rows with no contribution.
- ~~Scenario indicator integrated into header~~ — DONE (this session, item 17). Orphaned snippet now lives next to the avatar; trailing duplicate markup deleted from `base.html`.
- ~~Accounts/Investments table overflow on narrow screens~~ — DONE (this session, item 18). Responsive `hidden {bp}:table-cell` classes on lower-priority columns; `overflow-x-auto` retained as safety net.
- ~~Hardcoded `£` sweep on remaining templates~~ — confirmed already complete (this session, item 19). Zero `£` left anywhere in templates.
- ~~Plan-to-retire-in vs currency mismatch (#4)~~ — DONE (this session, item 20). 8 jurisdictions added — JP, SE, NO, DK, HK, IN, CN, AE — each with `defaultCurrency`, cost-of-living index, and a 2024 personal-allowance value. Requires `python tools\reload_ontology.py` (app closed) to appear in the live store.
- ~~Accounts vs Investments IA (#3)~~ — DONE (this session, item 21). Unified `/accounts` page. Legacy `/investments/*` POST URLs still backwards-compatible; `GET /investments` redirects.

### Post-1.0
- ~~**Dashboard redesign.**~~ DONE — see Asset model project (2026-05-25, item 30).
- ~~**"Sell asset" feature.**~~ DONE — `mrl:PhysicalAsset` hierarchy with auto-managed `LifeEventType_AssetSale` events (2026-05-25, items 27–30).
- ~~**Budget line sub-categories.**~~ DONE — ADR-017 shipped 2026-05-27 as user-defined `mrl:BudgetCategory` instances (not a fixed enum, per Mark's call) plus `mrl:BudgetLineSegment` for life-stage spending changes. See items 31–35.
- Tax-optimal drawdown ordering (ADR-011 future)
- PCLS dedicated model
- Multiple marginal tax bands (ADR-013 future)
- Per-jurisdiction Monte Carlo profiles (ADR-012 future)
- ~~Employer contributions (`isEmployerContribution`, ADR-015 v1.1)~~ — DONE 2026-05-27. Shipped as `mrl:employerContributionAmount` (decimal, not boolean) — see session item 42.
- Multiple contributions per account surfaced in UI (ADR-015 v1.1)
- ~~Per-budget-line currency~~ — DONE 2026-05-30 (session 7, item 52 — ontology 1.0.5).
- Separate "expected retirement base" currency (ADR-016 follow-on; not requested yet)
- Per-life-event currency (ADR-016 follow-on)
- ~~Income export/restore should round-trip `incomeCurrency` / `incomeExchangeRate*` / `creditedToAccount`~~ — DONE 2026-05-30 (session 7, item 53).
- Unify rate refresh into one "refresh everything" action across account types (ADR-016 follow-on)
- GIA cost basis from MFL data portability
- `mrl-core` namespace extraction when MFL is stable
- Remove dead `src/store/mrl-ontology.ttl` if confirmed unused
- MFL sister app
